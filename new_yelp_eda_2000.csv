5,-1,"i love sakagura. ??its a bit hard to find but i think that makes it part of the appeal. ??the bathrooms are designed to look like the ones you would find at a ""real"" sakagura (aka sake factory). ??desserts are to die for. ??i've tried many things here but the one dishes that stick out are the pork belly and the saba w/ ume sauce appetizer. ??the best sake selection in the city hands down."
4,1,"Ceviche mixto was great, the fish tacos were great, the tuna with avocado dish was really good too. We also had the cilantro tamale, which was good, but too heavy after eating all the other light dishes. Service was very good too. Great place for really good ceviche!!"
5,-1,Brooklyn's best-kept secret. Brunch and dinner are both scrumptious. Everything is locally sourced and seasonal and yummy. Sooo good.
2,1,Prepare to be annoyed. ??The food is unremarkable. ??The decor is lacking. ??And too many bloody hipsters.
4,-1,"Solid food, cute restaurant"
4,-1,The food here is really GOOD so I had to write something about it. ??I tried their falafel sandwich with a side order of Zaatar fries. Plus i also ordered the egg flatbread and ba'al salad for take out. It took a little longer to get the food but the wait is worth it. Also the lines were longer because it ??was lunch time. Very tasty food and awesome variety of salads.I highly recommend trying this out for yourself. Though they only take cash at the meantime so make sure to get some before you go there!
4,1,"Big fan of Balthazar. We strolled in around 7:30 p.m. on a Friday night and the place was hopping. Since it was a 2-hour wait, we opted to have a drink at the bar and wait for a cafe table to open - and it did, in less than 20 minutes. The hostess was super sweet and attentive, as was the bartender. We ordered the brandade de morue and foie gras & chicken liver mousse for appetizers - outstanding. Allow me to state here that these are not items I would ever order on my own, but my husband was trying to make me try new things. Salted cod mixed with mashed potatoes and liver mousse do not sound good to me, however both were positively delicious and well-done, with fantastic presentation. I was so surprised and delighted. For dinner my husband and I split the steak au poivre. Another outstanding item. The French fries were crispy goodness, the spinach on the side perfectly cooked and the steak - delectable. We asked for medium and they delivered it medium rare, but it was perfection. This is on my list of favorite places in NYC."
5,-1,Well my first official review goes to this wonderful God sent restaurant which me and my wife visited last night. At first I was a little worried about the service because the cashier didn't really know anything at all about the menu at all but the food wrapper saved the day he came and told what to order and how to order it. He suggested the chicken burrito with short rib and it was BOMBBBBBB!!!!!!!!!!! I hope I didn't get him in trouble he actually tried to make it for me but that didnt sit to well with whom I assume is the owner. My wife had the pork burrito which was spicy as helllll lol. Over all I love this restaurant. From the food to the staff. So the combination of the food and the food guro/foodwrapper I give u guys a high 5 star. Ill see u soon and tell him im sorry if I got him in any trouble.
5,1,"I went here for lunch with my family. They honored my reservation, which is unusual in the restaurant business. We were seated at a nice comfortable table. Service was prompt and attentive. We all had different items for lunch and no one was disappointed. Stand outs are; white shrimp salad, huevos rancheros, pulled pork sandwich and a juicy burger with a fried egg on top. Do Not miss the fresh ginger margarita. One of the best in the city. I will def retur."
4,-1,"Very fun for a group, though the place is small you might want to call ahead. I've been happy with everything I've ever eaten here. The pickled shots add an extra element of adventure to any meal here. Highly recommended."
3,1,"Came here for a private business event. ??There was about 25 of us. ??Service was excellent and the wait staff was courteous. ??However, the food was subpar but I'm sure there is a dish that would give this place 3 stars, hence the 3 stars. ??I would have given them 2 stars but I felt that would be too harsh. One thing to note is the ""butter"" they give you with the bread. ??We had vegetarians with us and I thought it was just regular butter but it wasn't. ??If I tasted it correctly, it has salmon flavor infused into it. ??So be careful if you are vegetarian that doesn't eat seafood. ??I like the concept but not practical. I had the lobster bisque, Herb Roasted Alaskan Halibut, Yukon Gold Whipped Potatoes and Glazed carrots. When the lobster bisque soup came, it had scattered pockets of what appeared to be film on the top layer of the soup. ??Maybe it was fat. ??I don't know, it looked very unappealing. ??Then I tried the soup and it was quite awful. ??The soup was bitter and too salty. ??They do give quite big pieces of lobster meat, which was fine, but the soup base, flavor, and seasoning was terrible. ??I saw some people not even bother finishing the soup. The halibut looked nice, tasted okay, but subpar. ??The fish didn't flake off and it was dry. ??The cream sauce wasn't bad but you really needed the sauce to make the fish taste good. The sides of potatoes and carrots. ??I really liked the carrots a lot. ??It was not soggy and it was fresh, seasoned properly and al dente. ??It was probably the best dish of the meal that night. ??The potatoes were definitely whipped but I wasn't sure if it was the type of potatoes used or if they used too much butter because the potatoes were dark yellow. ??Probably a combination of both and there was nothing special about it. For dessert, had chocolate chip cookies, 3 types of ice cream, and 3 types of sorbet. The cookies were relatively soft in the center and crunchy on the outside. ??I've had homemade cookies taste better. ??I didn't bother trying the ice cream. ??The 3 sorbets I had were the mango, lime, and raspberry. ??I liked the sorbet except that they were still frozen when they came to the table. ?? Overall, great wait staff, crappy food. ??Only thing I will say in their defense is that perhaps the quality of the food suffered because we had a party of about 25 or so. ?? ??However, as a customer, I would assume that they would want to put out their best food because they would want us to spread the word about how great this restaurant was. ?? I would not come back here. ??Dine at your own risk."
5,-1,"So freaking delicious I have to stop myself from coming here every night. All the chicken dishes are phenomenal and even if you skip the rice and just do chicken and salad (to save a few calories?), it's addictive. The falafel is perfectly crispy and light. ??Yum!"
4,-1,"My wife and I came down to Brooklyn to visit Brooklyn Museum and had Brunch at Cheryl's Global Soul afterwords. I had the most delicious pancakes I ever had. The pancakes were fluffy and moist, berries were fresh, portion size was perfect, it was just perfect and unforgettable. It will definitely be added to my ""to die for"" list. They had a little line to get in for Brunch but the server was very nice and checked on us a couple of times, and as soon as we sat down, the server came to take drink orders. (By the way, I recommend their Bloody Mary, hands down). Atmosphere was really laid back and lovely. I think we'll go back there for dinner. I've got my eyes on their Sake Glazed Salmon. Can anyone tell me about that dish?"
5,1,"Hands down my FAVORITE PLACE to go to.. I am serious.. I came here twice.. First, my brother came to visit me overseas and he loves Japanese food.. So I yelped and found out about cocoron.. My brother only wants authentic Japanese soba so he recommend me to order a cold soba.. I know most ppl enjoy hot noodles but soba you usually eat it cold.. So on my first time here, my brother and I both ordered a cold soba.. Mine was on a special menu with some beef, fried squid bites and the cold dipping sauce in cold buckwheat noodles.. Mmmm.. My brother loves it so much that he requested me to return and fedex some noodles for him.. I went back 2nd time with my friend and I decided to order their famous dip.. Mera mera dip.. It has mince chicken, bak choi, chili oil... It's spicy and delicious.. They suggested you to dip the noodles in for 5 seconds.. We came ??in a party of 4 so I tried my friend's dipping sauce and I am truly impressed with all of it.. After your meal, they give you a pot of not kombu water to pour into your dipping hot pot so you can drink it as a soup.. One thing, their appetizer is really small.. So don't be surprise! As for the wait?. I guess I was lucky that I never had to wait twice when I came here.. Can't wait to come back again!"
2,1,"I'm a week behind posting this. I have posted pictures of each dish named below however. Sorry... As part of our continuing efforts to try everywhere new, an ambition of my husband's, we went here for the first time on a Sunday for brunch with my in-laws. First, be advised: CASH ONLY! It is on the menu in caps, but at a very small size of print. Secondly, it IS pricey by my accounting. (Of the 4 of us, nobody's meal was less than $10 and we order cheap.) It also says BYOB on the bottom...? Walking in we were greeted by a blond guy wearing actual blue jean overalls. This and the small size of the place seem to be the main features designed to give a ""Southern"" feel to the place. The tables are set up in Italian long, family style. There are two rows in the place and each consists of 5-6 tables which are normally meant for 4 people each. At the far back of it is a larger size projection screen. (On our visit it was playing WWF and was obviously pointless since NO ONE was watching it.) The iced coffee my husband and I ordered (which we get everywhere on Sunday eating out events) was served in Mason jars of 1/2 pint size. (Which I know cuz I do home canning.) The coffee was unremarkable in my view. The noise level was impressively LOUD in a bad way. Maybe it's just me and my sound sensitivities, but a large group of people stacked together at tables PLUS loud music (which is loud in its own right) does not make me think ""comfort"". It in fact makes me think ""BAR"". And now, to the food.... My father-in-law got the ""Lunch Burger"" which was a straight up burger and fries for a price that seems too much to me. I am told it was ""ok, but not remarkable."" My mother-in-law had the ""Perfect Storm"" which looked to me like a salad with Salmon on top of it. She had no significant comments about it except she was glad she got the Hollandaise sauce on the side. Since my hubby and I often share our meals to save money and to try new things... He got the ""Breakfast Burrito"". (See his review for his thoughts.) The few bites of this large creation I had were not bad, but also not so delicious I thought ""I could never make something like this!"" In fact the reverse. My husband agreed with me when I said it seemed just like what I've made him for weekend meals before. (*Yes he got bonus points for saying he probably enjoyed mine better.*) Now to my order of biscuits and gravy... To my eye, it was a large portion. (Which I'd hope given the $$) The gravy had a bit too much pepper in it for my tastes. The biscuits were good and thick cut. I had a good 1/4 of it before I tasted the sausage that is apparently part of the gravy. While I do not yet know the skill of sawmill gravy, I hope mine is better. My hubby said he liked it, but the biscuits weren't as soft as the ones I make us. (*Yes, he got more bonus points. No, he wasn't trying to earn points.*) Note to self: next time hubby says he thinks I should get the pancakes, do it. The final bill was upwards of $50. Yeesh!! The overall meal was not bad per se, but certainly not what I'd call ""worth the trip or cost."""
5,1,"There are so many choices in Little Italy, it can be somewhat overwhelming. ??I have been to several of the restaurants and Pelligrino's is a standout. ??The service was impeccable. ??I had the lasagna and it was simply the best that I have ever had, it was so flavorful and the portion size was just right. ??I tried my sister's fettuccine Alfredo and it too was awesome. ??I had ordered that dish last week at a competing restaurant and this was definitely better. ??The sauce was creamier and thicker, it really clung to the noodles. ?? Another thing that really made this restaurant stand out from the pack was their tomato bread. ??Unique and delicious is the best way to describe it. One if my friends who generally doesn't like bread with her meal scarfed down several pieces. ?? A total of eight thumbs up from all of us!!"
3,1,"Had a slice of the spinach and artichoke and the margherita @ 4.50 a slice Spinach and artichoke was.. Different. Basically kind of like an Alfredo sauce poured all over the slice you can kind of see it swash around as you eat it. It was good for a couple bites, but was just too rich for me. If you like rich, you'll like this. Margherita was good, but typical. Definitely not the best margherita I've had in the city or anything though. Overall, worth stopping by to try, but not sure if I'll come back."
5,1,"Great restaurant! Fresh, perfect portions & great customer service. Highly recommended!"
4,-1,"The list is always changing and features uncommon beers. The food isn't the best I've ever had but honestly I don't come for dinner, I may just grab a snack. Highly recommended."
5,-1,"The rayu sauce is delicious!!!! ??Fantastic taste, excellent service, friendly staff and cool feeling place. The ambiance is very cool because they cook everything in front of you. The food comes out fast, especially in the dinner service. Overall, Totto was worth the wait, especially with bar seating. And now I'm craving some ramen."
4,1,"THE LAMB BREAST HERE IS OFF THE F*CKING CHAIN GOOD!!!!!! With that being said my friend and i had a very good time at Do or Dine...We loved the Steak Tartare...It had a really nice texture and was seasoned very well...Jam packed with flavor...Also enjoyed the playful Foie Gras and Jelly Donut...Would have liked the foie to be more evenly distrubuted throughout the donut, but no big deal... The Lamb Breast was so good that we ordered one more dish right before our entrees came out...Hope we did not interfere too much with the pickups back there... It was super super super seasoned but somehow managed not to be overseasoned? ??Yes I know very weird... Duck Breast and Steak entree were nice as well... Loved the decor and eclectic music selection here... I will be back soon..."
1,-1,"I can't give this more than 1 star because from start to finish the experience was a disaster. Ran out of rose, spaghetti and lobster came out with lobster covered in sauce in the shell and when I asked to have the kitchen remove the shell it was returned with part of the tail- none of the claw. That's when confusion in the kitchen began- saying their was no more lobster meat- I've never seen a lobster without claw meat- have you? Dishes were removed before everyone was done. And then they couldn't process credit cards. The overall confusion was unlike any I've seen in NY. I give it 1 star because the waitress was giving it her all and the food tasted good. The headache in the middle of the night from 1 glass of wine and the upset stomach along with the experience prevent a second star."
1,-1,"I went to this restaurant with my baby last Wednesday around 5 pm. I asked for a table for 2 and a baby, told them I was waiting for my husband. There were only two busy tables in the restaurant. When waiter sat us next to the restroom and never came back. I went to the bar where he was texting, and asked him if we could switch to another table, and so we did. When we moved to the other table, no one came to greet us, there were 4 waitress at the bar talking to each other and using their cell phone, and no one even bother to even look at us. After waiting 20 minutes, I saw one of the waitress taking off her sneaker and rubbing her foot, then she put her sneaker back and went back to the bar, without even washing her hands. ?? That's when I grabbed my baby and left. Absolutely no costumer service! Never coming back."
4,-1,"Went here with 9 people tonight. We all really enjoyed it. Great dumplings. The crispy spicy eggplant special was light and favorful. The fried tofu and bean noodle soup was a little bland but we ordered it vegetarian. The scallion pancakes were among the best I've ever had. I wish I had more room to try the cold mock duck amd the sesame noodles. All and all, a great find in the heart of Chinatown. We left full with lots of leftovers for $20 pp including tip!"
5,-1,"The service was impeccable, the food was all delicious. Highly recommended."
4,1,"Incredible NYC speakeasy; dimly lit, and with an earthy and classic feel. Dark Horse is nestled away on Murry St, walking distance from the 9/11 Memorial and Wall Street. Inside they have an awesome speakeasy feel with rustic and comfortable booths. They have about 10 TVs showing sports, and personal TVs at the booths. The staff was very welcoming, friendly, and attentive. I had the Dark Horse Signature Burger and it was incredible; easily on of the top 5 burgers that I have ever had. The burger was cooked perfectly and topped with bacon, onions, fried egg, and Jack Daniels gravy. I've never had gravy on a burger; but wow, what a perfect match! They have a wide craft beer selection as well. I highly recommend the Anchor Steam and Mangers Irish Cider. If you're looking for some good eats around the 9/11 Memorial and Wall St., certainly give Dark Horse a try! Make sure you check in on Yelp to receive your free drink while the offer lasts!"
4,-1,The food is fantastic here and it is a gem of a place. ??Nestled in the heart of the village this little secret italian place promises and delivers fully. ??Enjoy everyone.
5,1,"I am obsessed with this place. ??Before I lived in NYC, I would visit my friends often, and this is one of the first brunch places they took me to. ??I keep going back for the creative dishes, fun and young atmosphere, and people watching! ??I've had every kind of benedict, and they all hold up. ??They have a great Sunday night beer + burger special option, too. ??It's on the pricer side for brunch dishes, but the nice touches that come with the Smith (sparkling OR stilled water, the photobooth downstairs...) make it worth my money. ??This place is my go-to for out of town guests or if I feel like doing something special with my friends."
5,1,"I loved this place. Good food, good service and super cozy! Perfect for date night! The lamp skewers were amazing! Also had the peppers, chorizo, clams and cheeses ( weird combination i know lol) all very yummy! And you can hold a conversation. It get packed quick and people waiting in line so get there early!"
3,1,I have eaten here twice so far in the last two days .... ??Its classic southern food done well. I am a big eater so for me the portions were small and for the price I did expect alittle more. So far I had the pulled pork sandwich and the catfish both times I choose the mac and cheese which was good but I hate there cole slaw as it is vingar based. The slaw tasted like mayo slaw that went bad. Each lunch box which I had came with dill pickle chips which are very yummy. ??I will return back but only because its so close to where i am working now and I would rather pay alittle more for something good then get a whole plate of bad for less
4,1,"My boyfriend and I went to Alta for our Valentine's Day dinner and had a fantastic experience. We're not overly ""romantic"" people but wanted something with a cozy, charming atmosphere, and Alta definitely delivered. We sat downstairs in the main room near the fireplace which was great! The room had a laid back but elegant vibe. As for the food, everything we tried was delicious! I think my favorite dishes were the mussels, avocado relleno and shrimp risotto. We washed it down with the red sangria which was wonderful. I'm knocking off one star cause the service could have been better. However, I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to a friend. Especially a friend going on a date!"
4,1,"it's hearty comfort food. we came here for lunch last week. we had the chickpea and fennel soup, the spinach triangles, and the lamb sandwich. their portions are enormous - we were stuffed. their sage tea is a standout. the place is tiny and cute - charming simplicity. our waitress was nice."
4,1,"First lunch of 2012-retro W'burg retro chic decor- check. ??Nice wooden booths. ??Housemade sodas, a bar with many options. ??I was enjoying my booth early in the meal. Ordered: Cesar salad $8 Lobster Roll- $24 The food came together as requested. Cesar was garlicky, respectable, too full of nice brioche croutons. ??I would skip the Cesar. ??Head straight fot he Lobster Roll. Seasoned w/ some Old Bay, herby, chunky on brioche it is a mighty fine lobster roll. ??Fries were super salty- love that. ??Quite a bite for $24, but all in all worth it for a taste of summer on 1/2/12."
4,1,Amazing burgers. End of story.
5,-1,"A friend and I had brunch at Saxon + Parole a couple weeks back. So good. We started off with a basket of their homemade pastries and bread. I remember especially loving the cornbread muffin and mini cinnamon roll. Mimosas? Check. They had a healthy portion of champagne which is always appreciated. And although it's not my cup of tea, I saw a ton of Bloody Mary's going around. The restaurant had a cart set up where people could assemble their own and add accoutrements/toppings. It's like an ice cream shop for big kids over there. I ordered the Mangalista Ham. Eggs Benedict is my favorite meal, so it was a natural choice. ??The ham is sandwiched between a poached egg and a potato Parmesan cake. I loved the potato pancake and actually prefer it over the traditional English muffin. One of my biggest peeves is hollandaise without any citrus. I typically load mine with lemon, but the yuzu was a new twist, and I loved it. My best friend ordered the baked eggs and thoroughly enjoyed them. We ordered the basket of fresh doughnuts. We were stuffed, but it's hard to resist warm, sugar and cinnamon doughy pockets of amazing served with vanilla and chocolate sauces. Service was excellent - Kylie took great care of us. And the space was beautiful. I walked past the restaurant last weekend and saw the terrace was open. I'll be going back to brunch alfresco."
4,1,"I dig this bar! Cheap, tasty drinks + low-key, dive-y atmosphere + great location. The orange creamsicle is a conccotion of vanilla vodka and orange soda. Yes. Solid beer selection as well. Walking distance from The Nitehawk so you can get your drank on after an artsy flick. Will be sure to swing by whenever I'm in the neighborhood."
5,-1,"My absolutely ""favoritist"" restaurant!!!! The choices are amazing...I just wish there were small tasting plates so I coulod have a bit of everything!"
5,-1,this is the greatest thing i have ever eaten in my entire life. ??that is all.
5,-1,"This little spot serves superb food at very reasonable prices. The $35 tasting menu (that's appetizer, entre and dessert) is ??a steal. The French trained chef changes the menu seasonally and always provides choices in each category. The presentation is worthy of any French joint in Manhattan and then some. Service was quick and respectable. I was able to bring my own wine as they don't have a license yet and that only adds to the bargain. We are thakful that French food, beautifully prepared and so tasty, is available locally. Give it a try!!!"
5,1,The tacos are so authentic I forget I'm in NYC and revel in being South of the border on vacation . ??I usually get chicken tacos with their home made medium salsa but the quesadillas are equally sublime.
4,1,"I love Ngam & I love Chef Hong, she's so sweet I found out about this place because my friend saw Chef Hong compete against Bobby Flay on Iron Chef America & we had to try it! --pad kee mao: YUM my fav dish i've tried so far, it's definitely SPICY so beware!! tried it w/ shrimp & the shrimp was cooked perfectly --pad thai: good too, made the authentic way w/o artificial sauces.. they allowed me to order it w/ a mix of both chicken & veggies! --papaya pad Thai: a delish low carb version!! --green curry: fresh & served w/ rice --thai iced tea: they brew their own tea --thai iced coffee: not too sweet --coconut juice: YOUNG COCONUT so sweet and good served with slices of real coconut --brownie cake w/ lychee-like custard (this was complimentary to our birthday girl): sounds weird but they actually paired well together & the custard had such a unique flavor i've also come for the thai COOKING CLASS they offer once a month!! it was such a great experience, Chef Hong taught us so much about the ingredients! she even accommodated some of my classmates who were vegetarian NOTE: they have a HUGE wooden table in the middle of the restaurant that is perfect for large group reservations"
5,-1,Being that it was my first time in Dig Inn Kay Kay was very helpful in letting me know what your restaurant is all about. She really sold me on the sandwiches that I purchased 2. I will be returning most definitely.
5,1,Delicious. ??The Pho Real is fo real!!
4,1,"I think I wanna go to that spot on Atlantic Ave., the vegetarian one where -  My wife's head exploded before I could finish that sentence. Her combustion was for a noble cause, of course, defending my unwaveringly carnivorous ways. In fact, Maimonide Of Brooklyn supports its own form of martyrdom, as well, it would seem. No, not for the same cause as my own, as you will surely find no meat on the menu here. But to commemorate various befallen friends (in this case, fruits and vegetables), mounted like deer heads along one wall - ""Mr. Avocado, 2009-2010, died for guacamole,"" ""Miss Banana, June 2008-August 2008, died for banana bread"" - you get the idea. But before we go any further, let's resurrect the wife in this sensationalized account, so that I don't end up sleeping on the couch tonight. And she's back. Now. Why would it appear that I, a self-professed meat-eater extraordinaire, am pouring on the praise for a place that praises produce over processed animal entrails? It's no riddle, my friends. Even as a rabid devourer of protein-and-fat, I simply, sincerely enjoy the food at Maimonide, in all its earthy goodness. What helps is their vegetarian dishes' ability to prove themselves as supremely hearty, and not only healthy, alternatives for all my fellow meat-eaters out there. Take the Belly Charmer MOB, for example. Essentially a robust flatbread of sorts, in the shape of one of the Brooklyn Bridge's signature arches (or maybe just a boat to anyone choosing to ignore iconic architecture), this veggie vessel's cargo includes eggplant, pistachios, harissa, zucchini, mint, carrots, and about a dozen other items I don't treat my body to often enough. These ingredients are not only substantial picks, but the crust of this MOB is thick, wholesome, and delicious. Maimonide is also a bit of a brunch underdog. It flies far enough under the radar on the weekend that there's not much of a crowd - even though there most definitely should be. The Buttermilk Biscuit Sandwich is a fine choice (although I can't defend its ""sandwich"" status given it crumbles into pieces of eggplant, avocado, tomato, and carbs pretty much upon first grab), but the real winner is the Spicy Yellow Grits. Of course, this was what the wife ordered, so I was reduced to stealing bits of garlic sauteed kale and Japanese sweet potato ""sausage links"" from her bowl when she wasn't looking. Creative vegetarian cuisine aside, Maimonide Of Brooklyn reaches interior design nirvana. It's jam-packed with Kings County pride and Americana punk sensibility. Those same arches found shaping your tasty MOB are the same ones carved out as doorways between the dining area and the back bar / kitchen, again paying homage to the most famous of East River crossings. The wall opposite the aforementioned hunting trophies is a giant, re-imagined star-spangled banner, seating is comprised of four, giant communal tables, plus an arcade table (Pac-Man and Spade Invaders are free of charge!), the music ranges from jazz to indie rock to hip-hop, there's an origin-story-style comic book about the establishment for your reading pleasure, and there's even back patio outdoor seating for the warmer months. To all my carnivore comrades, while I know my enthusiasm here may be overwhelming, do not fear for me. I still almost always order the burger if I see it on a menu. Veal is still in my diet, even after seeing that South Park episode years ago where the boys discover it comes from baby cows. And bacon, well - my love for bacon isn't going anywhere. Call me an animal. No pun intended. But Maimonide of Brooklyn may very well be the first (and right now, only) vegetarian spot that's had me under its spell, to the point where I've actually craved it. It's conflicting and confusing to admit this, and trust me, typing it all out doesn't make it any more logical to me either. But just try to resist its casual-cool demeanor and veggie goodness. Wait, what am I saying? Where did this come from? Who am I? Man, it's enough to make one's head explode..."
5,-1,"The Chicken and grits could possibly solve all the worlds problems, it is absolutely absurd how good this is."
3,1,"Went here for lunch with my parents when they came to visit. ??We enjoyed their lunch special, $17 for a salad and trio pasta sampler, which is unlimited. ??The restaurant is cozy and service is on par. ??Caesar salad was great and the pasta was ok. ??It seemed like they cook it in big batches for this lunch special, and therefore isn't the freshest. ??Some of mine was cold. ??I would like to go next time and try an entree instead of the pasta special."
3,1,"We came expecting to be wow'ed. We left wishing we'd spent our money elsewhere. The wait staff were excellent, and the place has a great atmosphere, but the food was just average."
4,1,The entrance around the corner is hard to find. Love the atmosphere. The food is good enough to not distract from it.
2,1,"The food here is excellent. ?? My complaint is with the rewards program. ??Look, if you don't want to have a rewards program, don't have one. ??There is no law that says you need to have one and plenty of equivalent places just skip that whole practice. But, if you are going to have one, at least don't make it insulting. ??First, if I purchase two sandwiches, I should get two credits. ??Don't do it by visit. ??That's just dumb. ??Second, give me a friggen proper reward if I get t10 sandwiches instead of making me come back for a breakfast pita (yep, you only are entitle to a breakfast pita if you do them the favor of eating 10 regulal meals there). ??Thanks for the offer - everyone loves having Taboonette for breakfast. Seriously, your food is awesome although a bit pricey. ??Just take down the rewards program since you obviously don't want to reward your loyal customers. ??It's just insulting. ??Either that or make it a real program."
3,-1,"ok, let me say that I have been here a few times a while back and the food has always been good, but I just had to write this because of the recent service that I got. ??I went in the other day and I guess it was pretty early.....I didn't notice any signs that they were closed for dinner setup and assumed that I could get a table, So we went in and then just waited. ??I thought it was great, I stayed at the front waiting to be seated and everyone just looked at me and pretended I wasn't there. ??Two, ??what seemed to be bartenders to my immediate left at the bar, chit chatting away and a few staff all the way at the end, appeared to be counting their $$$. ??Anyway, I left pretty disappointed. ??You would think someone would say......""we're sorry, but we're closed until 6 for dinner setup"" or something. I guess they just had such a successful run they just don't care. This is what happens when a restaurant is just making too much money.......must be a nice luxury to have!!!!!"
1,-1,"As a Latino I've had better Spanish Food. This place sucks. It's a perfect location for the new transplant of whites that now dominate alphabet city. Don't waste your time coming here to find that Spanish rice or tostones or bistec, you won't find it here as i said it caters to blanquitos Latinos that don't know true Spanish food."
5,1,"It's rare when, from initial website perusal to walking into the restaurant, you think at every point along the way ""This is going to be just right,"" and it is. And not only just right, but SO right. Cookshop was, for me, that place. If I had to distill my guiding culinary principles into three words, these might capture them: seasonal, authentic, and creative. The first is clear enough: you start with what's there, then. By authentic, I mean dishes true to their composition; while I intellectually respect genius kitchen chemists like Dufresne, what I carnally desire is purer, less meddled-with food. By creative, I mean the ability to take those seasonal foods, respect their essential authenticity, and in doing so find ways to play them off each other such that the whole is more than the sum of its parts. Oh, and then there's lovely and decadent. Obviously.... If any of that rings true with you, get thee to Cookshop. The menu's already vastly different from when I visited a month ago, but this is the kind of place where you really should just ask what's good, or explain what you like, and you'll get something to love. My friend knows Andrew, the chef, and Andrew's explanation to me of the particular sauce he made to go with a pork chop is what sold me on that dish: a historical, oft-ignored recipe for something you don't see often (currants), but which contrasted in its red acidity so beautifully with that hint of sweetness and fattiness of the chop. And so it went for the rest of dinner, in all the plates. There's a different type of genius that's required for excelling at this kind of cooking; instead of manipulating food, you coax it. Instead of deconstructing it, you taste it and listen to what it tells you it wants. And then you do that, and get out of the way. And the way in which all this perfection is executed is appealingly comfortable; you don't see the work that goes into it, and the plates don't sit in front of you screaming to be admired. They want to be eaten, and savored, and enjoyed. So you'll do all of those things, and wish you could come back tomorrow for more. It's damn good food, which by my standards above makes it excellent. Add that to a welcoming, friendly environment with lots of bustle and energy, and brightness from the wall of windows onto 10th Ave, and it's one of my top dining nights to remember."
5,-1,"Best Vietnamese sandwich I've had in a long time--cheap, super fresh ingredients, and spiiiiiiicy! Plus, if you want to blow your lid or run ten miles in as many minutes, get an iced coffee."
1,1,"SO .. let me start off with I love artichoke pizza. I would give it five stars.. no really but this crappy 1 star review is for security letting some rich dude probably trying to impress his basic chick pay him to cut in line at peak hours .. not cool. ?? oh I was there 8/24/14 around 3am. so manager if you are reading this, fire that useless idiot that clearly does not know how to do his job. unpleasant experience. my pizza was amazing though. (the crab pizza is superior here compared to the other locations)"
4,1,"Tried this place for the first time during restaurant week last year with some friends. I was so impressed that every time someone comes from out of town or from another country, I make it a point to bring them to ilili! I've brought some friends from Australia, Argentina, Paris, and Sweden here, and all have been blown away. The Labne is out of this world! If your friends decide to share plates, make sure to tell them this one is not up for grabs. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE order the candy bar for dessert. You will not be disappointed!"
3,-1,"Food is good, but is it really worth the wait?"
5,-1,AWESOME SPOT. Food is usually great and service as well. Sometimes a little aggressive. Calamari is Great and a lot of other items. Great Albanian Owner!
1,-1,"I'm writing this review as my stomach churns from the disastrous pernil i was served at this place. Not only did the pernil taste like it was drenched in orange juice, my plate plus cup of coffee cost me about 21 bucks. As a Hispanic person who frequently cooks this meal and buys this meal, it's not that fucking expensive. The crowd is horrendous, they're lucky i didn't dine and ditch."
1,-1,"Never posted on yelp before but this is the first time my whole life a restaurant charged me more than I agreed to pay... They gave themselves extra tip on a dinner I ate there. I tipped them $10.50 on a $79.50 meal, they gave themselves an extra $6.50"
1,1,"OMG what a disappointment! We went specifically on the 4.5 yelp rating. Haricot vert salad to open was just fine. My wild salmon was overcooked and tasted farmed. The cioppino as a DISASTER! Each piece of seafood had that unmistakeable taste of notfresh. Overcooked AND notfresh! WTF?! We're just flabbergasted that a restaurant so highly recommended could disappoint so thoroughly. I hate to hate on a cute nice establishment like this, and maybe they had an off night, but...whatever. If you're a restaurant that specializes in seafood, make sure you serve it fresh."

5,1,"Joe Allen is a dark subterranean bistro two blocks west of the Theater District, and a great place for Happy Hour and/or dinner any day of the week. ??As with most restaurants in the area it has something of a reverse tide at dinner. ??Many customers come in early to have a very good meal before the 8 o'clock curtain. ??Thus, if you arrive for dinner earlier than that, you will witness the floor empty as the appointed hour approaches. ??By the bells it is mostly empty, except for those who understand the ebb and flow and are here to enjoy themselves sans theater that night. So it was on Wednesday when we settled into the cool darkness. ??Chris was our server, and he greeted us warmly while handing out the daily printing of the menu. ??He assured that everything described therein was available to us. ??We opted to share everything and requested everything be served together regardless of its place on the menu. ?? We went with the Large Caesar Salad, Pan Roasted Scottish Salmon, and a side of Roasted Broccoli with Lemon. ??There was plenty for the three of us. ??The Salad was loaded with fresh Romaine, Tomato, Red Onion, Peppers, Croutons and an excellent Dressing. ??The Salmon's Teriyaki Glaze was sweetly tart, and the fish itself was moist, yet firm. Obviously, it had been jumping rapids not long before. It tasted of its life. ??Under it was an Asian Slaw with a mild Vinaigrette, Peanuts, cold String Beans and Sesame Seeds, that we continued to eat long after the main ingredient was gone. ??The Broccoli was deep green and bursting with its subtle flavors highlighted by the Lemon. ??It was one of those meals where everything complemented the other, and the meal took on a magical quality between great food and great companions. ?? Not wanting the moment to end, and feeling no rush from the staff to settle up and leave, Chris returned with the dessert menu and a sly smile. ??He simply said, ""If you're feeling it, go for the Banana Cream Pie."" We knew he knew. Out came three forks and the largest swag of BCP I had ever seen. ??It stood at least 6 inches high; 2 inches of fresh cream topping, 3 more of cool delectable Banana Cream, and the bottom layer of sliced Banana and firm Graham Cracker Crust. ??I took a photo, but the image was not as powerful as the treasure before us. That it was orgasmic is an understatement, but will have to do as it was a pleasure best kept within to relish, rather than attempt an inadequate description. ?? Thanks Chris, and the whole Joe Allen crew for a job well done, and a fantastic evening. 5 Estrellas."
3,-1,"i tried this restaurant and appreciated the fine cooking,but still,i can say with all honesty that i do not like japanese food! its a shame,because the staff is so polite and the place is so prettty..."
5,-1,"Very delicious! The service is also quite good. I love the its environment, though not so big, but very Japanese traditional. :)"
2,-1,"I visited Adrienne's Pizza Bar this past Sunday before the Diwali Festival at South Street Seaport. The place has great pizza and very clean. Unfortunately, the service staff appeared to be blatantly racist towards anyone who isn't white. The service was inexcusably slow not only serving the food but also to the instance that no one wanted to give me the bill once I requested it. I hope other Indians, Hispanics, and Blacks take heed warning and boycott this establishment. I have already filed grievances with other media outlets foreign and abroad to the undeserved lack of service that I was subjugated to."
5,-1,"delicious cocktails, great backyard, what more do you want?"
4,1,"A great spot in Astoria......got the whole rotisserie organic chicken with whipped sweet potatoes and veggies. The chicken was delicious, cooked perfectly and big! I really enjoy that its open 24/7, with a nice bar and nice atmosphere to boot."
5,-1,"Perhaps my fave spot...small, dark (yet candle lit), comfortable... great selection of beers on tap (and no im not talking about bud light) and a great wine selection (fyi they only serve beer and wine)/ ??great date place, great place to catch up with a couple of girlfriends and a fantastic place to end your night. ??Always play a wonderful selection of tunes as well. ??especially nice in the summer, spring, fall to sit on a weekdy afternoon outside on the bench and have a beer..."
3,1,"First of all there are two places with this address - we inadvertently went to the first one we saw (not the real Momofuku on the CORNER). Food was pretty good but a little overpriced for Korean food. Although it's Korean ""fusion"". ??The rice cakes were chopped up and fried in bite sized pieces - decently spicy (our waiter warned that it was VERY spicy but I think he meant white person spicy b/c it was NOT that spicy). The bo ssam was delicious - a whole fish. The pork buns were good as well. Like I said, good ??but not amazing."
5,-1,"I LOVEEEEEEE mark!!!!!!! i never can get enough of this place especially their guiness shakes But one thing, Eric Rueben, where r the coconut shakes? :)"
5,-1,"Second only to Blue Ribbon Bakery in my mind. Get the fondue, ribs and/or poo poo platter. If you don't get the fried chicken you're fooling yourself. Only con is that there is no bread pudding for dessert - you can get some at the Bakery after."
2,1,Food was COLD today!!! ??I had a BBQ veggie burger and fries 2 weeks ago and Love them so much! ??But today my fries are cold (seemed they were sitting there for a while... and the burger wasn't hot either kinda warm-cold. I really think Food there is very very good. ??But I refused to pay $10 for cold FOOD. ??Soooo sad but not coming back...
5,-1,"Pork Spare Ribs were soo good! Lots of tender meat and very good BBQ sauce. Tangy, sweet, and zesty sauce. Delicious. All natural organic grass fed meats! I recommend the housmade CRANBERRY sauce that ??tastes so fresh and goes beautifully with the turkey. To top it all off the owner Matt and service are welcoming and honest. Super fun super nice! I can't wait to come back! Also they never freeze the food and it's always fresh! Almost ??like if IN N OUT burger had a BBQ joint....this is it Great!"
5,-1,"As soon as you buy it you MUST eat it. It's only AMAZING right then....don't let it get cold...once you do...it's a GREAT pizza....but still not as amazing...but you get the idea...lines are long, small space to order, be ready when you get there. Huge slice of a pizza I buy two slices and split it with my hubby!! We love it! (~$10 for dinner/lunch...not bad) We ate it so fast I never get a chance to take a picture of it! AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING! MUST eat the Artichoke pizza and eat it IMMEDIATELY!"
4,1,Fresh falafel and good drinks.
4,1,"Lemme begin with the payoff. This is a great bar. Terrific beers. Great atmosphere. Good food. I highly recommend it. However, it pays to be aware of specials on the board before you order. I was refused a great deal [any sixpoint or bklyn beer + a hotdog from Mile End (delicious food) for $8] even though I'd ordered those things, along with 2 sliders and another beer. The deal would have saved me $5. I was told I didn't qualify b/c the special only gives you the hot dog, but I also got a small ramekin of diced pickles and a handful of potato chips. Those were some expensive garnishes! ??Ones I didn't even really want. I hate pickles! Oh well. I'll still go back, but I will be more wary next time."
4,-1,Stopped here to meet a friend for drinks. Had the meatball app. It was tasty. Nice atmosphere but I didn't care for the music.
5,1,"*CASH ONLY* Atmosphere 3/5 - A smaller place with sort of limited seating at normal meal times so you may have to wait a little while (10-15mins) for seating. Lighting is meh but it's kind of a cute lunch spot. Service 3/5 - They're okay but often rush you out because of the lack of seating and high demand. Food 6/5 - Okay, here's the thing. I'm Vietnamese and I'm pretty sure the owners aren't (I tried with multiple people to speak) so I initially assumed the Pho would be pretty terrible. But wow, Saigon shack proved me wrong. So so so so wrong. They -consistently- have provided excellent pho with generous portions of both the noodles and the meat! They also have BBQ PORK CHOP PHO. This is actually really unheard of in Vietnamese cuisine and is AMAZING. Must must must must try this. The BBQ essence infuses and synergizes with the broth so well. A muuuust try. 6/5 for sure"
4,1,"Been here twice for dinner. Last time there I had the fried chicken and it was okay. First time I had the rice and egg dish and it was very good. I'll definitely get this again. I had several of the veggie apps and a couple of salads & enjoyed all. I've had the Old Fashion & Moscow Mule cocktails & both were very good. The space is nice, staff is friendly and I'll be back again."
4,-1,"One of my favorite wine bars in the city. The selection is excellent, the ambiance is great (indoors or out), and they have delicious small plates. ??Their homemade soft pretzels are a must. ??The burrata is excellent, too. Before 7p, their happy hour deal ($2 off each glass) is well worth it. Weekend nights, the place tends to get quite crowded, so going early is probably a safer bet. I've been many times and plan to return many more."
3,1,"So like most people, I'm like ""Woah, bacon. That's delicious."" Now I realize that there's a reason why bacon is usually a relish or topping for food, and not a main course. At the end of the meal, we all agreed that we were bacon-ed out. I had the bacon steak + bacon tasting. The bacon steak was very salty, like I was eating a block of salt. I'd imagine I have to really really really like bacon to consume this much sodium without flinching. So all in all, food was standard, nothing gourmet or amazing, just regular."
4,1,"Came in with the bf and friends in mid-craft brew bar crawl. ??Can't BELIEVE I never heard of it! It didn't feel as insidery or snobish as I though it might, which was huge points. ??Table service was quick for such a large place. ??I was getting beer'ed out, so like a lame-o got an Irish whiskey to warm me up; but everyone else was freaking out over the beer menu. ??I def want to go back soon!"
4,-1,"This place is definitely worth a visit. I read the bad reviews, but think those people should try again, and others should make up their own mind. Food was great - crabs, kids fish and chips, mussels (weakest dish), peel and eat shrimp, mac and cheese, and spinach. All that was about $120. Yes wait was long but we expected it and had drinks and played a round of mini golf. Was there with my 2 kids and service was good, and everyone was very nice - waiters stopped to talk to kids, told me not to worry about cleaning up all the stuff the kids dropped. The mini golf was a hit with the kids. The owner even ran down the stairs to help my wife bring the stroller up the stairs. We'll definitely be back."
5,-1,"I went there for lunch and this place blew me away. I had the crepe and I decided to have it with sausage, cheese, and mushrooms. It was out of this world. After lunch i split a chocolate crepe. Like everything else at this restaurant it was great. This is a true French restaurant and yes the food takes a while to come but I sort of enjoy that. The waitresses are very friendly and helpful. I don't know what this place is like for dinner or breakfast but it is the place to be for lunch."
5,-1,"4.5 stars Lunch special - one of the best values in nyc (especially on thursday). All the dishes are yummy. Buta kakuni, fluke carpaccio, cod, karaage, etc."
5,-1,"Finally, a place the old school neighborhood folks and the stroller toting yuppies can agree upon. Lucali sells pizza and calzones, and happens to have the best of each. Bring a bottle of wine (or two), and choose from the limited but guaranteed fresh toppings du jour. On a recent visit I and two friends got a pepperoni (REAL pepperoni, not the flourescent red atrocity you find at most pizzerias) and onion calzone along with a mushroom, basil, and pepper pizza. The calzone was filling but not imposing, with the perfect cheese/sauce/crust ratio. The pizza was thin and perfect, each homemade element blending with the next to create a perfect neighborhood concoction."
5,-1,"We loved our experience at Bouley. The restaurant is beautifully designed, with just the perfect degree of intimacy. The menu was exciting - the food gorgeous and delicious. The service level was first class - friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. We were absolutely pleased with our experience. It is quite rare when the hype matches the reality! This is definitely the case with Bouley - it knocked our socks off!"
4,1,"Bocca outside cafe is beautiful as is the inside. The ravioli with corn and mozzarella is terrific.Simple ,fresh, Italian food with great no frills service. Alexandro at the Bar makes the best cocktails. If you like banana splits Bocca has the best one yet 4 stars!!!!"
5,1,Love the brunch and move the dinner. Never had an issue. Foods always in point. Always tKe friends and family here when they visit. Probably best restaurant in our hood. Love the pizza better then Roberta's. And love the ham panini for lunch or brunch. So amazing. Reminds me of the Cuban sand at cafe habana in the city. Love the servers and hostesses everyone's great here always.
5,-1,One of my favorite places. It's delicious and beautiful inside.

5,-1,"As a vegan, I find that it can be difficult to find a restaurant that both omnivores and herbivores can be mutually happy ??eating in without either party feeling like their losing out on the meal. ??Sweet Afton is a great example of a restaurant/bar that gets it right. After reading an article in Boro Magazine (which, by the way, is great for those in and around the LIC/Astoria area) about vegan options in Astoria, I found myself on a mission to try all the locations (two down, three to go). ?? Sweet Afton offers a portabello mushroom sandwich w. sweet tomato jam, BUT make sure you ask them to use olive oil instead of butter, or just ask them to ""veganize"" it for you. ??It is fantastic, plus it comes w. a side salad. ??Just do it. Also, can we talk about the incredibly cute bartender/server? So cute. Here's the article w. the vegan tips: boromag.com/food/tasty-v?£á?"
4,1,"A friend and I were in the mood for brunch and decided to check out the legendary ""unlimited sangria bar"" that is Calle Ocho's claim to fame. We got reservations the same day, but that was most likely because we were a party of 2 - some of our other friends tried to book a table this weekend for 4 and none were available. Tip #1: Go in small groups. Tip #2: If you're going for brunch, don't get the omelette. It's good, but rather boring - eggs, tomato, and cheese. I need a little more spice in my life than that. Tip #3: Eat as much of the fresh bread and strawberry butter as you can... without choking, of course. And finally, Tip #4: Efficiency is the key to life. Eat a bite of food, get in line for the sangria. Take another bite. Get in line. Lather, rinse, repeat!"
5,1,"We had our wedding reception in the large private room downstairs in June 2013. Everything was great -- food, service, atmosphere. Just what we wanted. We had about 35 guests. I worked with the events team at The Smith's corporate office to do all the preparation/planning/menu selection and so on. The team there was very competent and focused. I can be 'particular' about certain things, but the event planners were patient with me, and were clear about what was negotiable and what wasn't. The manager on site, Josh, was terrific. He showed me the space several times, and even recognized my fiancee when she showed up for brunch with her mom a few weeks before the wedding. The night of the reception, Josh was there and everything went exactly according to plan. The food -- from the hors d'oeuvres to the entrees and dessert was delicious. Guests were praising it months later. My one quibble was that after Josh left late in the evening, the bartender disappeared for a while and I had to go chase someone down to staff the bar. But, that was a brief issue in a long and complex event and the team at the Smith did a great job from start to finish. If I had to do it all over, I would host my reception at The Smith again, and would recommend it to anyone planning a mid-size to large event."
4,-1,"First time here and will be back soon. We had great service from the time we walked in until we left. Our server Genesis made great suggestions- wild mushroom flat bread and arepitas w short rib so delicious! We had $5.00 Bacardi mojitos all night long. haven't seen these prices for quality cocktails in years. The vibe was great, nice people around us and the view was amazing. Told my office about it today planning a night out soon and this will be the spot."
5,-1,"I went to have dinner with my friends last night and I was really impressed. At first, I was a little bit confused due to the complex menu but then I found out that it is a ""cocina de author"" restaurant. The waitress was very helpful explaining the menu for us. As an appetizer, we had the black ant guacamole and we were very surprised when we realized that the salt used was made of real ants but it was really good. I had the crispy duck dumplings and they were exquisite along with the mayan god remedy cocktail which was a little bit sweet but tasted so good!! (this was recommended by the waitress) she was so right! The music was a little bit loud and the lights were dark but maybe it's part of the restaurant's concept. Two of my friends ordered the short ribs and they were delighted. For dessert we got to share the churros and the special dessert of the night that it was a winter sundae which was a pumpkin and chongos ice-cream with brownie at the bottom. We finished it all with the desire of coming back soon. I highly recommend Black Ant Mexican Restaurant!!"
4,1,"This place can get crowded, but for good reason: the food here is delicious. The service is okay. The servers straightforwardly took our orders and refilled our water cups, but nothing extraordinary. The food was savory: nothing disappoints. The coconut rice is delish."
4,-1,"I ordered from Zen for the first time today. SO PLEASED. I don't know about everyone else, but I'm always scared to try vegetarian food because I know how badly it can go wrong haha. BUT I ordered for delivery; the service was fast, the food was AMAZING, and the delivery guy was really nice (even though my dog barked him down) the prices are really reasonable. I'd recommend the deep fried wontons,they're amazing. the veggie dumpling aren't as great, and the sauce included. I thought it wold be better, but with the mango chicken and the wontons, I DONT CARE! sorry if my review is super long and spastic, but this is my new place to order from. Plus they wrap everything so so cute."
2,-1,"well i have been there before and i never had such a bad service like ??i had yesterday, we had a party for 8 and the reserve was fine but we order just cold cuts and cheese and it took 40 min to bring it to our table, i talk to our waitress and she told me "" yes i know it's taking a long time"" with no solution! or apologize, then our meat was supposed to be 3 parrilladas one well and 2 medium well and let me tell you that the 2 medium were so raw that ??we could have a conversation with that cow, she almost was alive! when we asked her to take the food back and cook it more she didn't take it very nicely, like if she had to do it, also was so careless to our table the only time she smile was when she brought the bill with her 18% of tip included."
5,-1,The best peruvian food in park slope. I recommend it to everyone.
3,1,"It is very important to me to give my honest opinion on yelp, which in some cases will not be so great. ??I had the B. Obama (smothered chicken: ??with lots of gravy and the buttered corn as a side) My husband had the Al Sharpton (chicken and waffles) with Mac and cheese on the side. Neither one of us finished our meal. Everything was very bland with the exception of the gravy on the smothered chicken. The buttered corn was horrible. (No flavor) The place was busy/crowded and there was a line outside. However, I felt the food was a waste of calories and $$. ??I have had better chicken and waffles at Brooklyn diner. An extra star was added for fast seating and fast service on a busy night. I guess it's convenient if you leave in that area but I will not be back."
3,1,"Cookshop is a beautiful restaurant packed with beautiful people. If only the food had delivered. My salad had too much dressing and was oily while my fish was under seasoned and the potatoes that came with it were practically raw. The bread of the house was dense and not especially delicious, it was also served cold. The sauce that came with my fish wasn't particularly savory and it was watery. So strange to have such disjointed food in a venue that screams success and is so packed. I was really disappointed because I don't think the farm to table concept really works here and at these prices, I am in no rush to return."
4,1,"Great GREAT place. Really cool and cozy set up, and the food and drinks were fabulous. If you are meeting someone or people for dinner and get there a little early, definitely grab a cocktail at the bar. It is an attractive bar and the drinks are amazing. Not to mention they have a pretty decent draft and beer bottle selection, as well. The food was incredible and at reasonable prices. You HAVE to get the rosemary wings; I promise you won't be disappointed. The pizza and pasta dishes were wonderful, too. Unfortunately our service wasn't that great for the party of nine we had the other night, however, I have heard that service has been on point for other diners during previous dining experiences. Location on Bleecker St is good, too, and in a lively location of the Village."
5,-1,"Just about perfect. Hell, Brancaccio's is better quality and taste than at least half of the restaurants in the Slope AND you get to chow comfortably at home rather than patiently ignoring inane Slopey banter. Win-win, friends. Here's all you need to know: 1) Brownie: Buy one, eat it, you're welcome. Try to keep it to one a week, if you can. 2) Cinnamon roll: Seriously good. Underrated. 3) Flesh of animals: Flank, pork, chickens and meatballs. Get them and you'll be very happy. Various incarnations and all are excellent. 4) Sandwiches: Rarely do I feel sandwiches are worth the money at most places. Joe's are worth the money. 5) Head's up: This is not a McDonalds. There are not fourteen-million of every item waiting patiently in a gigantic freezer just so you can have exactly what you want exactly when you want it. People love this place and they eat the hell out of the food here every day. Many times, I don't get my brownie. I'm cool about it. If you show up and they're out of something, be cool about it. Use it as an opportunity to try something else and I promise you'll still be thinking, ""Oh sweet mother of tastebuds how did I live without this?!"""
5,1,The best dosas around!!
5,1,Don't go here because we don't want to have to wait even longer for a seat at the bar. Best oyster/beer/over-all experience. Best birthday ever.
5,1,A taste of little Italy in hip Brooklyn. A few blocks from the subway and worth the walk. The service and food - A+++ ??Chef Andres Rodas has outdone himself! ??Best rissotto I've had and you have to try the pork chops! ??It was BYOB when we went but they may have gotten their liquor license by now. ??They also have a Piccoli to go in Park Slope. ??You're lucky to have a place like this in your neighborhood. ??This place is a keeper so don't let it go folks!
4,1,"We stopped into Emily for Saturday brunch and I have to say I was very happy with the experience. ??Truly delicious pizza walking distance from the ol' apartment? ??Heck yes, suckah! Atmosphere: ??Current. ??Cozy. ??Simple. Pizza: ??Thin. ??Crispy. ??Lightly-charred (yum!) Service: ??Friendly. The only hiccup in the experience was a temporary ice emergency that left us waiting a few minutes for our drinks. ??We were compensated handsomely with a delicious ice cream sandwich courtesy of the house. ??Perfectly handled. I'm super excited to add Emily to our regular restaurant rotation and explore the menu more. Try it... you'll like it!"
4,1,"Really enjoyed my experience at Adelina's this past weekend. We passed this restaurant randomly and it's Brooklyn charm had us selecting it as our restaurant of choice one lazy Sunday night. We each ordered a pizza, my husband the cheese and mushroom, and me the bell pepper. Don't remember the exact names. Both were delicious and the pizza crust had a sweetness to it that was amazing. Really good sized portions and both pizzas were just $13, not bad at all. We also enjoyed some of those specialty sodas they served, yum! The bartender happened to be the server and owner and was super friendly. He welcomed us to the neighborhood, introduced himself by first name, and asked us to come back again soon. Great atmosphere. When we were there two parties were reserved for birthdays that night which was great since despite it being a smaller place it has a lot of charm and entertains larger parties."
4,1,"Being a fan of Naruto, i got a craving for some Ramen. Yes, I watch Naruto. And what? Anyway, I've been at Ippudo's front door twice. One I got in, the other I walked away when the hostess said the wait time was over 2 hours. You know you would too! Thats too much time to wait. The time i did go, was during a weekday. I was seated within 15 minutes. I was with a friend and we both were impressd with the food. The ambience is cool and friendly. They clap and cheer when you order more noodles. I'm not sure what they say. But whatever, the point is, the noodles are great and not too pricey. I got the classic noodles with extra pork. IT WAS GOOD! when you go there, remember ""Kae-dama"" means more noodles. But if you don't finish them, its a sign of dis-respect to the chef. At least that's what I was told."
3,1,"Before this place, I was a yakitori virgin. ??We ordered a ton of food, from meatballs, to bowls of things, to chicken skewers. ??Everything was good, but I wouldn't say that they blew my mind. ??We made a reservation, and walked over from the Rockefeller Tree. ??Good spot if you're near the area."
3,-1,"I wish I could give it 3.5 stars, I would if I could. I went to St. Anselm on a Sunday night around 8ish. There was about a 45 minute wait but this was no problem because we just went next door for a beer. It was one of those nice fall nights we had last week and it was a great way to spend the evening. When we did get to sit down I was very impressed by the menu. I thought it had a great number and variety of options. It was humble but impressive. We decided on the tomato and burrata and a bowl of shishito peppers to start. For our entrees with got the butcher steak med rare and the pork chop medium. I know this is no fault of St. Anselm and totally the fault of US for ordering the shishitos knowing that the whole buzz around the seemingly harmless pepper is that one in a bunch is crazy hot. Well... I've had them before and I've never had a hot one. But this time around my girlfriend bit in to the bad seed. It was maybe her fourth pepper too so the whole bowl was kind of tainted after she spent almost 20 minutes with smoke coming out of her ears and her eyes watering. I mean it wasn't me but she looked pretty uncomfortable. But again, no fault of Anselm. Just... beware if you order the peppers. DO order the burrata though, yum! I mean it's hard to go wrong with creamy mozzarella and a ripe tomato but yum yum. I couldn't get enough. Alongside our entrees we ordered the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. The potatoes were good, very latka esque. The spinach was amazing. I was crazy for it. The steak, 5 stars. So good, cooked and seasoned to perfection. But the pork is where I had to knock a star. Don't get me wrong, the meat was cooked outstandingly. And perhaps this is my fault too because on the menu it did say bourbon glazed but I don't think so. This was not bourbon glazed it literally tasted like the chefs just dumped a couple shots of bourbon on top of the chop. The flavor was raw and distracting. It did not compliment the meat, it detracted from it. Yes I will stick with the word distracting. It was very distracting. For desert we ordered the bread pudding. It was just okay. I kind of wish we had opted for the strawberry smore kabob because that looked awesome. The atmosphere was great, service was ok, food was mostly expert and the night was memorable. I would go back and I would recommend it. Very well done."
5,-1,"It's always crowded, but you can get a seat for 2 still sometimes. The lamb chops and half chicken are the best I've tasted yet, especially the lamb which is very tender. The ambiance is nice, a little loud at times, but if you can get a reservation and have seats in the back, it's great for a small group or a date."

4,1,"Where Pommes Frites of NYC meets Frjtz of San Francisco, it may be a tie. Both are better than each other in different ways but end up being equal in satisfaction. Face it, a regular order of fries for $4.50 at Pommes Frites can feed a group of three. Stacey C is my witness on this one. We were stuffed. The ??large fries for $4.75 at Frjtz is less frjtz than the small at Pommes Frites but it's also served in a fancy glass versus the paper cone of Pommes Frites. Glass or paper, you get twice the frites at Pommes Frites! Even while you wait, you are offered samples of fries and sauces. And we're not just talking one frite here. We're talking frites! But if you feel like being gourmet, Frjtz is the place for you. Less is more there. Plus your frjtz can be drizzled with garlic or truffle oil. Decor. Pommes Frites fits right in by being a box in NYC. It also has the charm of a dark wooden pub shack. But if you feel like you'd rather be in a club space than a pub space, head over to SF for Frjtz' futuristic Zen like renovation. Variety. I think every one of Pommes Frites' dipping sauces are likeable versus only a few of Frjtz'. Frjtz' strong point in that not only do they serve frjtz, they also have a ton of other things to offer from crepes to mussels and fine wine. Pommes Frites concentrates only on what they do best: the potato! So you see while Pommes Frites has it's moments, it's just as good but a little different than Frjtz in San Francisco."
4,1,"I'm reviewing Isabella's for its breakfast. ??Not brunch: breakfast. ??A friend and I met up on the UWS one day, 9:50am. ??Almost every place around was closed. ??We didn't want to go to a diner, and as it was a beautiful day, we wanted to sit outside. ??Isabella's came to our rescue. ??Or rather, we came to it, because it is a stationary thing, being a restaurant, and we are mobile, being humans with feet. ??And... anyway, some tidbits about this place: * Isabella's is open early, weekend mornings. ?? * Isabella's has more seats outside than many restaurants have altogether. ?? * On Sundays, for breakfast, Isabella's offers complimentary fresh juice (orange or grapefruit) and coffee or tea. ??Some places charge for these things; when you take this into account, Isabella's ends up being close to inexpensive. ??And the coffee is excellent. * The table bread they give is basically dessert--we got zucchini bread and carrot cake, both very good. ??You could make a full breakfast just from the complimentary items, come to think about it. * The dishes on the menu are all safe breakfast/brunch options, but well done. ??I got huevos rancheros and my friend got a daily special, pulled-pork benedict. ??Both were delicious, and and and: the eggs are free-range."

3,1,"There are fewer places in my neighborhood that I enjoy eating at more than Casa Adela. It's open for lunch, has a laid back attitude & consistently serves up excellent Puerto Rican food. Entering the place there are 3 things that you will immediately notice; Delicious chicken dancing in a rotisserie, Latino TV on a small set in the back & owner Adela Fargas with her army of family members & employees working away endlessly among the diners. I normally order the half a chicken with yellow rice & black beans, but as of late I've been trying other dishes. I recently had the bacalou (dried cod cooked with veggies in a tomato sauce), the roast pork & the chicken stew. All good dishes, but the chicken is still my favorite. It has a deep red, flavorful skin (I'd really like to know how they spice this dish) & succulent, moist flesh. I've tried to replicate it at home & just cannot get anywhere as close. With the weather being this cold, you might also want to try out the Sacocho, an awesome soup with loads of root vegetables & a chunk of oxtail. ??Guaranteed to warm you up! The cafe con leche there is also really good, as well as the flan which is made using cream cheese & has a very unique flavor. The average meal will run you about 10 bucks or so, but trust me when I say that you'll leave more than satisfied!"
2,1,"Let's be honest...this place would never survive in a more competitive neighborhood. Penelope is the best option in a part of the city with not a lot of brunch options. Positives: Coffee while you wait, cozy atmosphere, prix-fixe brunch is nice (if you want coffee & OJ), tasty croissant sandwich with yummy pesto dip, reasonable prices. Negatives: Insanely crowded, overly-crunchy home fries, and pretty bad service. Our server was forgetful and inattentive (forgot things on both my order and the table next to us), it was impossible to get coffee/water refills, and everything about the experience felt rushed. Brunch is supposed to be relaxing, and this was anything but. Wouldn't go back unless, like this time, I needed to meet someone in the neighborhood. Many better options further south and in Brooklyn!"
4,-1,"You could go here for the atmosphere alone, but the FOOD IS SIMPLY TO DIE FOR! I have been twice and each time the food has been some of the best Ive ever eaten. The food is amazing, and the service was perfect. This is a place you dont want to miss... make sure you make a reservation :)!"

5,-1,"wonderful experience here at a specially themed prohibiition dinner. ?? A friend told us about it and thought we'd give it a try, and we were very happy we did. ??The place ??was papered over with a faux-prohibition notice in the window and a password to get in; ??staff dressed in 1930s attire. ??It made for a fun and different ambience, which set the tone for the delicious cocktails and food. ??What made it still more enjoyable were the talks the chef made before each course, explaining the historical context for the dishes. ??His enthusiasm for both his food and the history of it all was infectious, really enjoyed the evening immensely. ??And the wonderful and well priced bottle of barolo only added to the experience. ??Look forward to returning for another themed dinner -- they evidently have them once a month -- and also to try them for their regular menu. ??Highly recommend."
2,-1,"Rye had the rare distinction in Williamsburg of having both fantastic cocktails and fantastic food. ??Unfortunately, for some reason their drinks have really gone down hill, which is a shame since there is a lot of great food to be found in bburg but only a handful of truly great cocktail places...all of which are slammed every night."
4,1,"We have eaten here twice in the last couple of months and were delighted both times. The broth is very tasty and the noodles nice and chewy. The big detractor here is the place and the service. It is tiny and the second time we came it was 98 degrees outside and about as hot inside. It was like a sweat bath and we emerged drenched. There is no ambiance whatsoever - you sit elbow to elbow with others or with strangers at the same table; the focus here is clearly on the food. Since lines are very long, it's not a place you'll linger in. Nevertheless, the food is generous and tasty, great place to stop for odd hours meals (like mid afternoon) before the lines get abominable."
1,1,"#1, their friend potato slices are not crunchy, not soft, not salty, not not not good! #2 the sauces (we had 3 of them) were not good #3 the service, takes awhile, and they will happily help others before you #4 pricy #5 long ass line for really not yummy version of the fry. McDonalds has better fries, even when the batch sucks. #6 super super small like capacity for 10 people all jammed together like a pickle jar so sad, because we had watched you on TV, and we couldn't wait to try it...and then we did and we were very disappointed..."
4,-1,"Absolutely fantastic pizza. Hands down. Thin crust, quality ingredients, and perfectly cooked. I came here for the first time a few weeks back and have already been again. The vibe is loud, boisterous and social, with communal seating, music blaring, and multiple open areas to seat yourself. The place is hip as well, the staff and decor all scream ""Brooklyn"", but not in a pretentious way. The cuisine and ambiance are both 5 stars. The only reason I give a slight downgrade is that I believe the food and wines to be a tad over priced (although still a price I'm willing to pay)."
5,1,"I was seriously impressed by Jack the Horse. ??Nice decor, excellent service, a couple blocks from the movie theater, and: -great drinks, including a very well-made Old-fashioned -phenomenal trout salad. ??Way, way too much for one person as an appetizer. ??I could have ordered this as an entree and been 100% satisfied, and I don't know if I've ever said that about a salad. ??Maybe, just maybe, the best salad I've ever had in my life. -Pork chop also outstanding, with really excellent oatmeal to go along with it. ??My companion was really pleased with the oxtail risotto as well, but it was a little overwhelmingly creamy for my taste. ?? Sorry I didn't find this place sooner!"
1,1,I came here for brunch recently and the food was worse than mediocre. We only ordered the frittatas and they were unbelievably greasy and heavy. My friend could not finish eating his. I ordered a potato and sausage one - the potatoes were hard and not fully cooked. I've come here for dinner before and that experience was mediocre too but better than this brunch. I'm not sure why I went back.
3,-1,went with a bunch of friends and we enjoyed it pretty much. food is alright and seating is good cuz we got one of those booth things. had a fun night.
5,1,"Food was absolutely amazing!!! So fresh and full of flavor, without being heavy on the stomach. In addition all the dishes were cooked to perfection (nothing over or under cooked). Cheese pastries Flatbread Chicken Steak and eggplant Cheese Fritters Light cream, cherries, and buckwheat cake (my favorite) All were fantastic. Couldn't stop eating."
2,-1,"As a person grown up to love noodles, I must say that they were pretty good. But ??if you are a party of 3 or 5, forget it. The restaurant, designed for communal seating, only seats tables of 2 and 4 in a prompt and timely fashion. Any other seating arrangement you will be waiting for centuries. Even if a couple arrives way after you have, they will be in and out the door way before you are seated. We went knowing we had to wait, but after seeing couple after couple entering and exiting before we even got our chance i began questioning the hostesses method of wait times and seating. After kindly asking her why she was doing what she wAs doing, her rude , unprofessional and lack of consideration of customer service put ,e on the edge. To our experience even worse, we ended up with a greedy, selfish and inconsiderate waiter who believed that placing a bowl of noodles in front of you was fantastic service. Coming from the service industry myself, a tip is earned and reflects not ony your service, but the experience the restaurant gave. Well after we gave what we thought was an appropriate tip for our poor experience, our server complained about his tip. Saying that our poor experience at the front of the house had nothing to do with him and that he was a poor student trying to make a living and that he wasnt being paid enough by the restaurant. Well dear greedy server, Tip is earned not deserved - it's not only about you, but how the whole restaurant treats you You have the right to ask if there was something wrong with the service, not to ask for more money If you have an issue of being underpaid. That is a discussion between you and your manager, clearly someone is making money and it certainly isn't you If you aren't happy with your tip, then give it back. Sincerely A disappointed customer"
1,-1,"This is a cool spot to grab a drink, I guess. ??But it's also a place where you can find a two hour wait for an experience that you'll pay $100+ for and end up with food poisoning from bad oysters. ??And the food that doesn't make you sick, is just blah. ??I've given them two tries, and REALLY wish I hadn't given them the second chance. ??In their second month they still haven't gotten it together, so no more Brooklyn Crab for me and mine."
2,1,"It's ok. I guess. Tried these guys at Madison Sq Markt at their booth. When I asked, what the spread was they were glopping on my biscuit (I thought it was cheese) I got a cheerful reply of ""it's honey butter!"" I would have preferred asking me if I wanted that or ""how much"", not 4 inches deep. Too much. That's just too much gunk for my sandwich. They squirt a little hot sauce on top of the chicken on top of a biscuit. I'm going to have to give them the benefit of the doubt, since the sandwich was ok, but that butter was a tad overpowering. I'm going to need to try the other menu items here."
5,1,"3 more visits to this place - still a solid 5 star rating for this place. New dishes discovered: thai basil sauteed veggies, rama dish (peanut sauce with loads of veggies), and even better, reasonably priced sake chilled perfectly. Or if you are in the mood for wine, great selection each for 7.50 to 8"

1,-1,"Don't go to this restaurant. The owner is ruled. When we got there, waiting for a table for 5 for like 20 mins, finally we got a table. There were another party after us, they got to sit in a smaller table, and owner came out and they asked the owner if they can switch table with us. Owner said ok to switch. The waitress told the owner we had five, my friend thought they have more people so she agreed to switch. After we sat in a smaller table, we saw they were also five people, so we asked the waitress why we had to switch with them if we both have party of five and we got to sit in that table first. We told you we have five people. We switch cause we thought you have more people. We felt a little bit discriminated against us. Would you tell your owner to explain. Few second later, owner came out yell at us and without explanation and told us to get out. We try to Explain everything to her, but she woundnt listen and tell us to get out. She said her restaurant discriminate no one and we have to leave the building now. We left this restaurant very unhappily. Worst experience ever:("
2,-1,Overrated. Not worth going back. They served an undercooked chicken and didn't take it back.
4,-1,Cheesecakes are out standing. Tried the classic and strawberry ones. The breakfast steak was very rubbery though. That's why only 4 stars. Go there for their cheesecake.
1,-1,"I've been a regular customer for months, brought friends and widely recommended it. ??I was there the Friday before last, sitting at the counter facing the grill and while waiting for my steak heard the main chef, she said to the others ""I didn't cook the sides."" ??A new guy working there said ""and I..."" ??I couldn't hear what he said, but when my steak arrived the sides weren't cooked like usual and it was so salty I couldn't finish it. ??I've always been complimentary and polite, but it was clear she prepared a deliberately substandard meal. ??I debated writing this, there are some great people working there, but it's such a patent violation of basic principles that I can never go there again nor recommend it."

The tacos are very good. ??I had the steak and chicken tacos and both were wonderful. Great service, beautiful space, reasonable rates. Highly recommended. ??I just hope they get a liquor license - margaritas would make the meal even better."
5,-1,"This is my favorite restaurant! ??Although I don't get to go here that often, but when I do go, I am HAPPY!!! This place is good for smaller groups, 4 or 5 max. ??I tried to make a reservation for my birthday, but they told me my party of 12 had to be split up into two tables. ??Of course, I didn't go cause I couldn't leave my friends behind, but believe me, I had to think twice about it because the food is THAT GOOD. The food is great and so is the service. I've only been here for dinner. ?? Appetizers: Calamari - good, not great. ??Isn't in my top five places to get calamari Mussels - we tried both the shallots and white wine sauce, as well as the chorizo and onion. ??I would have to give the upper hand to the shallots and white wine. Entrees: Grilled pork chop - OMG, it is to die for. ??The first time I had it, I was in heaven. ??However, the last time I had it, the pork chop was a bit overcooked (might have been by the size of my party - 6 and we were ordering up a storm, we didn't even have enough room on our table ;x so our entrees may have been on the grill longer since we took a while to finish our starters - calamari, mussels, fries) Linguine con vongole - was a bit spicy for my test, but that didn't stop me from finishing my plate Steaks - My go to steak at Landmarc is the strip or skirt. ??I've tried the filet as well, but I prefer the other two. ??Cooked and seasoned to perfection. ??You get to choose a sauce, but I prefer not using any. Oh, I forgot to mention the fries. ??The fries are so DELlCIOUS. Dessert: Ice cream cones - cute, but not worth it. I will definitely be coming back here soon. ??Oh, forgot to mention, another plus is there's always parking in the area. ??I normally go on Friday evenings and there's always parking, which is rare in the city."
1,1,"I don't understand how this place got 4 stars. When we walked in, my friend and I were excited as we saw quite a few tourists there, but also a lot of locals. So we thought we couldn't go wrong. I don't know if the kitchen was having a bad day, but the smothered chicken was flavorless, and actually had a terrible after-taste, the fried okra was basically pieces of okra covered in semi-fried thick dough... the salmon croquettes were actually pretty good. But we felt so sick afterwards---for hours. It was heavy, and sat really terribly in our stomachs. I didn't eat anything after that for a good 8 hours. All my friends told me I should have just gone to the Red Rooster and not mess around... Live and learn."
5,1,Good food. Great music! This would always stay as my late go to for good music and late night snacking when all else fails. Great crowd and awesome DJ. The shark skin dumplings were the best and the chef I believe was also Filipino and made us Adobo with rice one night since the kitchen had already closed :)
4,-1,"Really like this place. Came here with a big group around 7:30 and they were super accommodating in giving us a place to sit as we waited for rest of group to arrive. Service was wonderful. Food was good- better than bar food but nothing special. Music was fun- like fist pumping dance music at happy hour but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Overall, very clean fun place for big group. Great service and atmosphere."
5,1,"I'm a fan!!! Great service (got free bloody mary!), amazing food!"
5,1,"Imagine if this place was open 24/7 ... that's the kind of planet I'd like to inhabit. ??I'll keep it short and sweet: you must eat the tacos here. I absolutely go crazy for how good they are each and every time. ??The meat (or chicken) is always super delicious and well spiced/marinated. ??All of the other ingredients (always asking for tacos ""con maiz con todo!"") are super fresh and delicious too. ??Sigh, I am moving soon and writing this review is breaking my heart because I'll miss this place, the dozens of tacos it has fed me and the endless memories I have with people I've brought here."
3,-1,"Love their fries and bread but the noise, crowd, and poor service makes the dining experience not so great."
5,1,Heard about this place on Midtown Lunch while I was looking for something new. The food looked good from the pictures I saw so I decided to try it out w/ my coworker since it's only a couple blocks from my office. The place is very cute and gave a cute caf?? feel and the owner? was very friendly. Got the 1/4 chicken with the roast potato side. So delicious! Chicken was moist and flavorful with a nice crisp skin. Potatoes were absolutely perfect (a little on the soft side which was fine). We sat a table with two other people and sort of joined in their conversation which added ??to the intimate feeling. My meal came to $8.17 and I left feeling satisfied and pleasantly sated. My coworker got the chicken caesar salad and she said it was excellent and fresh. Both of us are planning on coming back here again this week to try something else.
3,1,"Sigh! Maybe it's the hype that let me down, and it let me down dearly. I'd read great reviews, heard raving friends, tried scheduling reservations that required planning months in advance, and marshaling up friends to commit to a brunch like it was a trip out of town, a month in advance! By the time I got around to the stars working in my favor of the pilgrimage to Calle Ocho, the ambience was factor #1 in mission letdown. The food, especially for a vegetarian, was scrumptious, wholesome fare with a rare combination of ingredients. It was filling without giving me the ooh-so-greasy-tummy-fill that eating out usually leads to. While the unlimited sangria is such an amazing attraction, once we got there, my friends didn't, or rather couldn't, go crazy like they'd hoped. There are specific sizes and you need to finish a reasonable amount of one before going in for the next. They were also jilted by the incredibly diluted sangria. Be prepared for several trips to the restroom to feel anything of a buzz. If I were to remove the hype, it's a place with amazing value for money : delicious and uncommon food with unlimited sangria for a challenging price."
4,-1,"Very good pizza but I'm partial to my neighborhood spot Barbancino. Still-- worth making the trek to Bushwick for Roberta's. Long line, but the outdoor waiting area and bar is an experience in itself. Lives up to the hype."

3,1,"Queens Comfort is unique for Astoria. Besides having an evolving daily menu, they are also BYOB and specialize in southern comfort food. Although not the healthiest of places, Queens Comfort aims to evoke nostalgia through their food, using kid-friendly ingredients such as Eggo waffles for their fried chicken and waffle dish, Honey Smacks cereal sprinkled on salad, Oreo doughnuts, and a PB&J Burger, with Skippy's peanut butter and grape jelly spread on a beef patty. My friends and I found ourselves at Queens Comfort on a Tuesday night, a bit later on in the evening for a late dinner. Having checked out the menu online, I was excited to learn that they had two types of mac and cheese as appetizer dishes that day: a scallion mac and cheese, and a bacon mac and cheese. As I was ordering the scallion mac and cheese, I was told by the waitress they had run out. I was really looking forward to this and had it in my head I was going to have it there, so I was a bit disappointed to find out so last minute that they had run out for the day. I also had a question about the meatloaf sandwich, and learned they were out of that as well. ??Our group decided on the fried green tomatoes with ranch dressing, and the corn with Parmesan cheese and sriracha sauce drizzle for our appetizers. For our main dishes we had the Animal Burger, the Fried Pickle Burger, and the Pulled Pork Sandwich. All three came with fries, and ran for $12 each. The fried green tomatoes were a delightful surprise. Considering they were covered in a thick coating of breadcrumbs and fried, they were light and not soaking in oil upon their arrival. The tomatoes were fresh and perfectly coated and seasoned in the breadcrumbs. I was expecting the generic store bought, thick ranch dressing to come with it, but was pleased to see a lighter, homemade ranch sauce arrive at the table, which did not overpower the taste of the tomatoes. The Animal Burger consists of caramelized onions and ""animal sauce."" Not knowing what this animal sauce was, I figured it would be some blend of mayo and ketchup, which I believe it was. I enjoyed my burger wholeheartedly but was not impressed with the fries, at all. After eating a few of them, I gave up on the spuds. They were overwhelming soggy and limp, and so saturated with oil that many of them were translucent. They were also lacking seasonings, and not hot. I love fries but only when done right, and that to me means crispy, fresh, hot, and salted. Queens Comfort fries lacked on all fronts. And it wasn't just mine - the fries that accompanied the Fried Pickle Burger and the Pulled Pork Sandwich were the same."
2,-1,"I'm sort of surprised, because everyone's reviews are excellent. ??Maybe we went on an off night? ??The sommelier was strangely rude (she brought a bottle of wine in place of the one we ordered, allowed us to try it, and when we said we didn't care for it, she walked away), and the service was really slow. ??The bread was great, the starters were good, but my main, the scallops were not so great (I didn't love the tomato sauce, but the fennel was good). ??Beyond the funky service issues, I just felt like the tastes weren't really satisfying. ??I felt like there was something missing from our meal. ??The bread pudding was good, though. ??As were the deviled eggs. ??Sad! ??I wish it had been better!"
4,1,"It's Saturday night. We are to wait about an hour for a table of five. So we toast our hands by the fire with drinks by our side, in the back porch. A scruffy cat greets us. We finally get to order. Other three order pizza in different style while I order chicken with kale on today's menu, while my man orders pork chop(diced apples/herbs on the side), along with a bottle of red. So far, I'm digging the cozy atmosphere. Super high ceiling like a cabin/warehouse. Kale is flavorful. Chicken is delish. I get to taste pork chop. Our service is prompt and friendly. We even have leftovers for tomorrow. Even though Roberta gets bit pricey and out of our way(Manhattan), we'll be back."
4,-1,"It was suggested by a friend and I loved this place so much. i would definitely gonna try this place ??out again and again. My first experience was quite good enough to decide about the place. I liked the food and the service is quite great to visit this place again. The atmosphere is awesome with the quite relaxing and calm surroundings will definitely make you fan of this place. I would definitely try this place out again. I had chicken taco which was awesome. The service is worth to experience, you should also have to go to experience this place. You will love this place."
2,1,"I had such high expectations for Gaia with all these 5 star yelp reviews... I stepped in hoping to be wowed but I had a very mediocre meal with shitty service to boot. My boyfriend and I stepped in for an early lunch. The waitress was setting some tables and didn't even acknowledge us as we walked into the restaurant. We stood at the counter waiting to order while she continued to set tables and work on some things in the back, all which seemed very non-urgent to me. If you have customers in front of you, you should tend to them first instead of worrying about putting out sugar for coffee and moving around empty pots behind the counter. When she finally acknowledged that we were ready to order, she took our order and then continued to work on whatever chores she had to do in the restaurant. She did not go prepare our orders right away. We waited maybe 10-15 minutes for our panini (which by the way, was freaking amazing). We had 2 more pasta dishes to follow. The first came out 10 minutes after the panini, and the second came out another 10 minutes later. In our situation, it wasn't a huge deal because we were sharing everything. But if we were not sharing each plate, we would be sitting there waiting for the other person's dish and letting the food get cold. I saw some fresh bread being pulled out of the oven and asked if we could get some to accompany our pasta. I received 4 cold and measly sized pieces of bread, square pieces just 1 inch by 2 inch. The pasta was very unimpressive. ??The spinach and ricotto gnocchi was basically a loosely packed spinach ball. Perhaps there is a regional difference in what gnocchi should be, but this was not the kind I was hoping for. The lasanga was mostly pasta with no filling, and the pasta was a bit too al dente for my taste. Our panini was amazing and if I only tried the panini, I would grant this place a higher rating. The bread was perfect, thin and crisp and it was stuffed with tons of meat. A great deal for just $5. The panini really was amazing and ??solely for that reason I see myself returning for a cheap lunch and to gauge any improvement in service."
4,1,"I really like this place and as many have said, it is far better than Chipotle, mostly for the fresher ingredients. ??I would give this five stars if we were rating this style of American burrito joints only, BUT to say that these are the best tacos in NYC just isn't true. ??I've only lived in NYC for a couple of weeks, but have had better tacos at a couple establishments in Hell's Kitchen (I'm thinking Tehuitzingo Deli Grocery more specifically), where they serve up the real authentic stuff. However, it is the best place I've been to so far with this style of burritos/tacos and I'd recommend it if you like Chipotle. ??I heard that these guys graduated from college and did a tour of the West Coast, meticulously noting aspects of burritos and tacos that they liked and then combined them to create Dos Toros. ??Well done, sirs!"
5,1,One of my favorite izakaya in midtown. Nice food and atmosphere. Helpful service is a plus :)
5,-1,Really good food.. I'm coming to eat here again.... Love the food..... Reminds me India!!!!!!!
5,-1,Delicious. And deadly spicy.
5,-1,"Bistango is a casual trattoria that hits all the right notes. The staff is welcoming. The decor is clean and uncluttered. The food is exceptional. I had lasagna - it was covered in gooey and chewy mozzarella and a meaty Bolognese sauce that was out of this world. Dining companion had capellini with shrimp and spinach, and she did not leave any on her plate. Other dining companion, who has gluten intollerance pigged out on pasta with Bolognese sauce - most of menu can be prepared gluten-free. Prices are more than reasonable. This is a place you want to return to again and again."

4,-1,"I'm a regular at brunch now, and the food and service is consistently fantastic. ??Food is always fresh and pleasantly spicy. ??Their homemade hot sauces are outstanding. ??Service is always pleasant and water and coffee are refilled regularly. ??Outside tables are a nice bonus!"
4,1,"Small Plates - Tapas Love the decor here, easy on the eyes, borderline cozy/swanky spot with plenty of seasonal variety on the menu to delight your taste buds. Some how ended up going on a tour of the kitchen here (yep it's sparkling clean) and if you're interested I'm sure you could go for one too (there is a small private dining room on the other side of the kitchen). Date Rating: 8 Pick up Scale: 4 Strong Suggestion: ??If they don't have a table then just sit at the bar. ??It's cozy and always a comfortable seat."
5,-1,"Delicious Kati Rolls at a great price. I like the simple egg roll. Its fresh, light and delicious. A great snack or lunch place for anyone in the area."
5,-1,"Fabulous ! Delicious ! The best sushi that I had in my whole life. They already catch me, I will definitely come back again and again, they do not accept tips, but still a little expensive ."
2,1,"It may be that I just have to try this place again, or go for a different slice, but I found the signature spinach & artichoke slice a bit disappointing. Though rich and creamy like a good white pizza should be, I found it almost too greasy to eat, even on a stomach full of beer. Also, take note that there's no seating available at all and no bathroom."
5,-1,"Really elegant and authentic Greek in the heart of the East Village. It's a tiny place but you don't feel claustrophobic. Food was delicious. Started with traditional dips and their homemade bread. Then had the scallop and arugula salad app then the Shrimp and Scallop over homemade egg noodles. All was great. They only serve wine from Greece, ours was very good and prices are reasonable. I would return"
5,-1,"I started going to Wafa's a couple weeks after it opened and have made sure to go there once or twice a week since. The food is relatively inexpensive ($5-8 per sandwich), healthy, and good. I would rate her falafel among the best I've had. The design is different then most as well. Instead of cramming a small pita to the near breaking point, she stuffs a large pita about half way and then wraps the rest of the pita around the sandwich to increase its sturdiness, which also make it much easier to eat. The area doesn't have many Mediterranean/Middle Eastern places, let alone one with a comfortable atmosphere. The inside has a hand painted and textured ??mural of a Lebanese seascape, while the rest of the restaurant is painted in peaceful, mellow colors. There are two cafe tables with two chair each and a bar along the window with another four chairs. They were successfully able to transform the space into a comfortable, cafe-esque environment enjoyable for longer stays and pleasant for pick-up and go. Wafa, herself, is the cook and all cooking and preparation is done in front of you -- something that I greatly prefer to a back kitchen. Also, everything in the restaurant, including deserts, is made by her, which I find to be a precious rarity these days. The service is super friendly and kind and yet another bright point the restaurant has to offer."
4,1,"I hope this concept expands. ??Like Baskin Robbins 31 flavors, its all about the different flavor sauces. ?? Its also nice the fries are one of the best. Curry ketchup! (Btw, I could totally see this being a successful ""food truck"" enterprise in LA if anyone else has any entrepreneurial spirit. ??My advice is royalty free!)"
5,-1,"If it was food alone, 5 stars without hesitation. Spaghetti with seafood, fried calamari/zucchini, and pizza about as authentic Italian as they come! Sauces were great and homemade pasta tasted great! Now for the service... My family came in around 5 pm and the restaurant was pretty empty. The staff did a pretty good job of ignoring us until I finally flagged down a waiter. Not sure if he was assigned to our area, but there were no other waiters around. His attitude was like we were bothering him. He hurried us through our order, and then disappeared (did show up at next table, regular/someone who knew the chef...and boy was he kissing up!). Our water glass was filled exactly ONCE, and aside from that, there was not much service. Nobody bother to clear off anything, offer dessert, etc. At the end of the meal, I stacked all our plates in the middle of the table and waited/watched. It took 10 minutes before someone noticed and took them. I counted staff members walking by at least 20 times and nobody noticed?!?! The waiter never showed up again (nor did any other wait staff). I don't recall the last time I did this, but I flagged down a manager and complained. He was very polite and apologetic, and offered us a discount as well as free dessert (skipped dessert since we just wanted to leave). I told him the food was fantastic, but I wanted him to be aware of the poor service. With such poor service, it wont matter in the long run how good the food is! Here is hoping things improve should we ever go back!"
5,1,"i have written a lot of 5 star reviews because i don't want to waste my time and efforts on mediocre places and my mother taught me that if i didn't have anything nice to say i shouldn't say anything at all (unless it's about dojo's). that's why i have only been writing reviews on places that i think are stellar. when my friend chris ??and i went here for the first time we both said ""holy sh!t"" and almost crapped our pants. this place makes me want to cry. i knew the place was going to be promising when we discovered we were the only one and a half non-japanese people in there except for one other group of two or three caucasian people. we were given a gift certificate here by our employers because chris won a contest selling the most sake at the restaurant we worked at. when we asked them to make sure the certificate was valid they told us that we wouldn't get cash back for any unused portion of the gift certificate. we laughed in their faces and literally said ""bring it on"". the food menu excited us but the advanced sake menu made us wet ourselves. needless to say say we walked out of there with stomachs full, with the perfect amount of tipsy, wallets with about $140 less in them each, and happy as hookers on payday. i have been back several times and the place never ceases to amaze."
4,-1,"estaba s??per rico, pero el anticucho estaba muy picante"
5,1,Excellent pizza. ??They used to make this amazinv goat hash on polenta for lunch that I lived for. ??Love that they make their own pepper olive oil. ??Almost always a wait.
4,-1,"Very good sense of making dishes they have. China Town=Barrio Chino China meet Mexico, East meets West!!! This place is definitely good place to hung out with your homies!!"
5,-1,"Checked in early Tuesday. ??I was in the area taking care of an assignment and since I was on someone else's nickel I figured I would pick up a sandwich to share with wifey. This was visit number 2. 1st time trying was about 2 weeks ago. I saw the place on an episode of Diners Drive-ins & Dives and knew I had to visit. 1st time had the roast beef, eggplant, and mozz. Very good ! Eggplant thin and tasty, cow was tender, and the mozz was ... in a word, ??GOOD. This visit was an Italian combo with lettuce, tomato, and onion. We always get vinegar on both sides of the bread with any sandwich we order and this time was no exception. It was almost 2 and a half hours before we dug into this log of deliciousness and we were not disappointed. My only complaint was there was not enough vinegar. No big deal ... that's why we have 55 gallon drums of red wine and balsamic vinegars in the basement ( :- ). However you have to get here, ... on someone else's nickel, ??your nickel, ??back of a radio car, ET's bicycle, ... get here. You will be glad you did."
3,1,"It's decent. ??The food and place is clean. ??I have high-ass expectations when it comes to falafel. ??Thats what I ordered, and it wasn't spectacular, nor bad. ??So-so. ??My favorite in New York is still Mamoun's in Manhattan. ??Best in the world is a hole-in-the-wall in Beirut. ??This place is ok for falafel, but I have yet to try their kabobs so I'd give it a shot and come back."
1,-1,"No, I am not drinking the haterade. ??I came here all the way from West Vlaanderen to tell you all the TRUTH: deze zijn NIET Belgische fritjes. ??To repeat, these are NOT Belgian fries! ??My 1 star rating comes from these facts about the fries: 1) They are not prepared in traditional style of flash frying twice in ox fat 2) They do not *look* like Belgian fries 3) They do not *smell* like Belgian fries 4) They do not *taste* like Belgian fries I even tried ordering in Dutch there: ""Voor mij, frietjes met mayonnaise."" and my words fell upon deaf ears. ??I cannot tell you how many times those words were followed by exchanging 3 euros for delicious, crispy but not too crispy, Belgian fries, filled to the point of not being able to balance in a small paper container, topped with a ton of mayonnaise, at 4am. People need to realize that in Belgium, fries are a national tradition, and they are eaten almost daily. ??They have a consistent flavor and smell that you can find anywhere in Flanders. ??That this business claims to have ""Authentic Belgian Fries"" is one of the most terrible lies in this city."
1,-1,"My wife and I have been going to Almond for a number of years, and were never disappointed until last night (9/28/13). ?? My Marinated Grilled Octupus had no taste, and included potatoes fillers. The potatoes were new to the dish and were as tasteless as the octupus. ??So disappointed because this use to be my favorite appetizer at Almond. For dinner I had the Halal Cart roast lamb breast, yellow rice, etc. and my wife had the Day Boat Scallop & Smoked Duck Breast corn ragout, five onions, sauce ""espagnole"". I could have gotten my dish from the street vendor opposite Trader Joe's on 14th Street and it would have tasted the same but a lot less expensive. ??My wife's dinner was suppose to have Smoked Duck Breast in it, but it was no where to be found on the plate. ??No plans on going back."
4,1,"Don't do it, they said. ""You'll waste food"", they said. ""It's for parties of 9, but really we recommend it for 12-15"", they said. ""Let's do it anyway"", we said. 50 dishes. 8 people. Everything on the menu. The Whole Shebang. Killed it, we did. Then we had some cake. After going back again, I'd have to say that I still think that the food is good, but not amazing. I suppose now I can somewhat say that with authority as I've tried everything. Some 4-5 star worthy items, in order of preference: - Braised short rib with beet-Barbaresco spaghetti - Japanese grilled eggplant with feta and watercress - Lamb tagine - meat fell off the bone and the root vegetables, so delicious! - Fried goat cheese, lavender infused honey - Crispy brussels sprouts, apples were a great addition to this dish - Warm creamy polenta, not usually a fan, but always willing to give it a try in a different form, pleasantly surprised by this texture and preparation. - Housemade pizza - fontina cheese, crimini mushrooms, thin crust PS. I've attached a blurry menu."
5,1,"A nice piece of Paris, a walk away from home in NYC. Excellent dinner here with my boyfriend for our anniversary. Made reservations and we were seated right away. Waiter was very attentive and very french. We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay, suggested to us by the server. We had the duck pate and french onion soup to start. Both were delicious! Pate was flavorful and well presented, and the soup was piping hot and yummy. For our main, we ordered the Parisienne PEI mussels and the duck confit. The duck was perfection! A perfectly cooked thigh and leg with super crispy skin served on a bed of frisse. The mussels were very largely portioned and the saffron mustard sauce was great for dipping the bread in. We ended the meal with creme brulee and apple tart a la mode. Great laid back dinner with fine fine food. Will definitely be back very soon to try their brunch menu and many meals to come!"
5,-1,Alta is seriously great! This is by far my favorite tapas place in the city. It would be an absolute crime not to try the brussel sprouts!
5,-1,"This restaurant is simply amazing. ??I LOVE the concept and have had the most incredible meals each time I have visited Feast. ?? First off, kudos to the ownership on the decor. ??I wouldn't have done it different myself, and it's just a lovely place to sit and hangout for a few hours. The food...OMG. ??If you order the ""feast"" the portions are small but mighty. ??You'll be wondering if you're eating enough and then BAM, you walk out of there so contently stuffed you will wonder when and how it happened. ??The food is just delicious. ??They have already changed their menu once or twice since opening, which keeps me coming back for more to try their new inventions! Great beer and wine selection too! ?? I love, love, love this restaurant and am tickled pink that it's in my neighborhood."
4,-1,The meal was excellent. ??The appetizer veggies - beets and mushrooms were exceptionally delicious. ??The cod (which I had ordered at Freeman's last week and was disappointed w/ the blandness) was delicous! ??The chicken was yummy - but a bit too much salt. ??And the desert was divine - we ordered the chocolate caramel tart and sage ice cream. ??The house muscadet was delicious. The tables are kind of tiny and we were seated on an end and constantly bumped and jostled. ??I would not call this a romantic spot. ?? But the management was very aware of our plight were lovely comping us not only our wine but also our desert. ??The waitress was lovely and very attentive. ?? I had a great time and look forward to going back.
5,-1,"Numpang I love you. I love you so much that when I went back to LA, I put you as my profile picture to remind myself of all the good times we had. Whenever my friends from NY checked in at your restaurant, I didn't know whether or not to cry because I missed you or rage in jealousy of my friends who were with you at that moment. And after a month of not seeing you, I met with you again and that dreadful distance and time did not weaken this love, but indeed strengthened it. Okay jokes aside. This is a bomb sandwich place. Pricey but filling! I usually get the porkbelly, but tried the brisket and pulled pork one time and they were pretty good. SO MUCH FLAVOR packed into each bite paired with the minute tanginess of the pickled veggies= winning! I didn't like the corn on the cob though.. rather have cafe habana's. Didn't like the salad either.. but yall know how I feel about the sandwiches. Eating 3 pork belly sandwiches in one week finally got me over the obsession with that sandwich. But def am coming here again for the pulled pork :)"
4,1,"Mmmmmm so good. I ordered the spicy crab cake Banh. The bread was really perfect with a nice crisp crust, but not at all chewy or tough. The crab cake was deliciously craby and just the right amount of lumpy. It came with crunchy carrots, refreshing cucumber and jalape?¡Óos. Just the right balance of all of the flavors involved. I also got a Vietnamese iced coffee that easily rivaled some of the better coffee shops!"
4,1,"View is beautiful. ?? Food was delicious! ??Drinks were really good. ??Cool bartender surprised us w berryish mojitos that were sooo good. ??Table service was a bit slow, but non the less, great evening. ?? Will definitely go back to try brunch."
5,-1,"This place is definitely an off-the-beaten-path gem in the LES. ??The paninis and salads are super fresh and delicious. ??Gaia, who is also the hard-working business owner, bakes her panini bread daily and after one bite, you'll wonder why you ever ate any other sandwich in your life. ??The prices are ridiculously reasonable for the quality and amount of food. ??I haven't tried the entree dishes yet - that's for future visits. ??Impossible to regret a visit to this shop - Go!"
5,1,"this is HANDS DOWN my favorite place in NYC. their happy hour deal is amazing... 6 oysters & a beer for $12 - you just can't beat that. did i mention their craft beer menu is always changing? its $4 more for a glass of wine with the happy hour which is fine with me, i just love a glass of chilled white wine while i eat some oysters. the service here is phenomenal. every server knows every oyster and their qualities. i tend to like really briny west coasters, and they always recommend the best ones for my taste. i am OBSESSED with the fettuccine & clams. seriously, i dream about this dish. i fantasize about the dish. i would come here every single day if i could. oh, and the whiskey cake, forget it. it's the perfect end to a perfect meal. upstate, don't change a damn thing :)"
4,1,I've been here a couple times for brunch. Good fresh juices (haven't been since they got their liquor license) and the $10 amazon plate is delish. The owners are warm and friendly. Lovely patio in the back for nice weather.
5,1,"Wow. ??I hate being one of those people who gives five stars to the totally hyped New York hole in the wall, but Totto Ramen is going to force me to do it. I had the spicy ramen (not the super spicy one, just the regular spicy one) with pork and extra noodles. ??The pork was both tasty and tender. ??The noodles were perfectly cooked. ??The portion size was awesome (and the guy even had me eat my regular portion before giving me my extra noodles so that he could fit more in my bowl). The ramen was great. ??The service was great. ??The atmosphere was friendly. ??The only criticisms that I could possibly come up with are that it was a very small space, and all that they do is ramen. ??Of course, that's probably why they do ramen so very well. If you haven't been here, get here."
4,-1,"Great portions, long wait but worth it"
4,1,"Great brick oven pizza in Park Slope with friendly staff. ??The restaurant itself doesn't really stand out, looks like your typical neighborhood pizza joint but the brick oven pies are definitely better than any other I've had in the vicinity. ??If they had their 2 slices for $5 special late at night I'd be here all the time!"
1,1,"It is sad I have to write such a negative review because I had eaten in this place before and I believe the food is good. ??But what happened last Sunday was EXTREMELY unpleasant! I made a reservation for 4 people and 2 of us arrived early. ??We announced ourselves and we were asked if everybody was there already. ??I said ""no, they are coming"", so we were invited to sit a the bar. ??So far so good, it is pretty customary to wait for all the party to be present before sitting at the table. OK, no problem. Then other TWO parties arrived, just a couple of minutes before my other two friends, and BOTH of these parties were waiting for other people to arrive. ??Well, BOTH of these parties were invited to sit at the table (even if the full party was not there, and without even asking us if we wanted to sit at the table as well) with the result that when my party was ready, we were not able to sit right away and they ended up offering us the most remote table inside the the room in a dark corner and far from the open window and the sun. ??No one of my friends was happy about it, it was a beautiful day and we all would have preferred to sit closer to the window and fresh air. ??But we were never even offered a choice. ??I am sorry but we had our reservation and we arrived before. ??We had the right of being offered the same service. ??The lame excuse of the host was ""sorry, we were under the impression you preferred to wait at the bar"". ??What? We were invited to wait at the bar, that was never our choice! This is definitely not the way to treat customers. ??We ended up leaving Palma and eating somewhere else. Very sad for a good restaurant."
5,-1,Love ramen Would never have expected this like this place as much as I do. The food is amazing and the staff is so nice! There isn't anything I wouldn't try! Nice little spot!
5,-1,"Loved it! 1 dollar a piece fresh oysters during happy hour. Who can argue with that? Perfect place to grab a drink at the bar, and enjoy some tasty oysters after a day of work, without feeling like you're in a packed subway car. Small plates: Ham biscuits--amazing--melt in your mouth delicious. We had to order another plate of them. Duck rilletes with pickles=perfect--just the right portion size. great balance of flavors. My friend and i were so impressed, that we stayed for dinner. Main Course: the porchetta. Best i've had in the city. served with cabbage and apples. perfect. moist. flavorful. not too fatty. really loved it. ?? after this experience, went online to see what the story was, and learned that the great food is coming from Chef Rob Berry. I loved what he did at Cookshop for the past few years--where i was a regular--so no surprise that i loved what he's doing at Monument Lane. I will definitely be back, and will highly recommend to friends. Only bad thing to mention is the decor. It's a bit hokey: maps and flags, etc. This is not Cape Cod--It's New York--keep the decor clean, simple, and classic, without the gimmicks. Long story short: my new favorite place in the west village for delicious dinner."
2,1,"This is an okay place overall and if it were not for this incident that left me frustrated, I wouldn't probably be rating it, since there is nothing remarkable about it (I prefer places with more character and individuality). I met up with a friend here who was in New York on business. Once we parted, as I sat in a cab I realized I had left my favorite umbrella (great quality, I've had it for a while) at the bar. It was raining earlier that night. ??The bar was nearly empty. I called my friend who was still at the bar. He gave the umbrella to the bartender who was serving ??us (she was pleasant and we tipped her generously) and told her is pick it up in the afternoon. My friend left late, around 4am. The next day at 2pm I went to the bar - they said they didn't have my umbrella and didn't even apologize for it. Once I gave them the bartender's name and all the details they told me to call or stop by later. I called later. The manager didn't even know what I was talking about. She said she'd check and call me back - she never did. In a couple of days I called again and spoke with a different manager who actually called back and said they no longer had it. I was very disappointed - although my friend left the umbrella with a specific person, the bar staff could hold on to it for less than 10 hours and the manager did nothing and showed no interest in trying to remedy the situation. I understand mistakes happen and people steal umbrellas when it rains, but a sincere apology, a proper attempt to locate my property or at least an offer for a drink, would have kept me coming back and resulted in a better review for this place."
4,1,"Ok...here's our 2nd attempt at getting to this spot. After a 2-hour+ nighttime cruise around the Hudson and East River we were hungry... A short taxi ride later we hit Big Wong King ??1 hour before it closed (9pm). And the duck must've been good as it was sold out. Damn. So no duck and wonton noodle soup (yes, I was greedy as I wanted to compare the wonton with the other Big Wong place down the street!) So I had beef brisket noodle soup. My Dad ordered the intestine (it's an old skool thing...) noodle soup with wontons. And my Mum had the chow fun beef with peppers. Why I'm not sure... So the beef brisket had the extra weird cuts in with the chunky beef bits. It could've been cause it was the end of the night...or it might have been a 'delicacy'. But not to me :) But it was pretty good. I also got to try my Dad's wonton. Good, but Big Wong @ 102 Mott is better. The biggest disappointment was the chow fun. Leave that alone. Boring and dull. Even with chilli oil!"
4,1,"The smith is great, its like old reliable. No the food is not going to blow you away but everything is really consistent from the food to the service. Great for brunch and dinner. They also have a great cocktail list as well. I find myself here when we can't figure out a plan because its always just good."
4,1,"House pino Grigio is great! Pretty lame to go to this type of place and get wine, but it was tasty. And it was the only place that we could find within a few blocks of our restaurant. The bartenders and servers were also nice. Kinda thought it was strange that they save a 5 person booth for 5 people and kick out anyone who has less. Why not just take what you can get? Place fills up pretty quickly at 6 pm."
5,1,"Not sure how to rate Korean food in general, but I definitely enjoyed it, and the buffet style is great if you're new to this food, so you can try a little of everything. I'll definitely be back many times."
5,-1,The food quality is very high and all meal have very good taste staff and crockery etc very beauty full.
2,-1,"I've heard a lot about Joya. Mostly good, therefore I decided to dine here. It was a busy night for a Tuesday. We had to wait for 20 minutes for a table for 4 people. Food was mediocre. Service was friendly though. Definitely, not an authentic Thai restaurant."
5,-1,"Ths is the second time that I have been to this restaurant I live in Manhattan but have friends in Astoria and tscond time around they were as good as the first. ??They didn't disappoint. ??I ordered the crabcake appetizers the lamb lollies and my friend had the fish fillet ??which was fantastic. ??The quality of food is really really good and its the best addition to Ditmars Restaurant Row in a long long time. ??We had some reallynice Australian wines and the place was really busy but the service was good. ??Dont be surprised if one of the owners comes by and stops and speaks to you as this is the way service is at this restaurant. If you havent been to The Thirsty Koala go and enjoy you will love this place great vibe, service and food"
5,1,"kakiage, gobo or ikaten udons are my favs. karaage is really nice, too."
1,-1,"The hostess kicked me out the door since my party has not arrived yet. I had to wait for my party out in the cold. And the cruel thing about it, I can hear the waitresses laugh so hard for what they did to me. Ok, I understand they're busy and I still want to try the yakitori and compare it with my authentic yakitori experience from Tokyo, Japan. As soon as my party arrived we went upstairs to be seated. Disappointment - really tight, customers are elbow to elbow in a very cramped space. I was still excited to have my first yakitori. Another disappointment - The food taste like gas from the grill. I do not mind it being pricey knowing I will be happy with the food. But yuckkk!!! Aside from the bad treatment, it was really a very disappointing night."
5,1,"Did the seasonal tasting (not the vegetarian one) and it, as well as the service, was impeccable. I don't remember which bottle of red we ordered, but it was heavenly. And the Bulleit cocktail on their menu was superbly done as well. I can't say enough how great everything was. I'm mad I'm not there right now."
4,1,Will always have a special place in my heart open Christmas morning at 1:30AM . The bartender was friendly and even though he was ready to close he let my fiancee and I enjoy a two hour post engagement champagne toast and even charged me the bottle price instead of the by the glass price which I thought was insanely nice of him. Did not have food but based on other reviews I will be checking them in '13.
5,1,"Made with TLC (Tender Loving Care). ??The owners go the extra mile to order fresh, local ingredients. They also change menu items based on produce that is in season. ??Some have reviewed this restaurant as being too pricey, but the portions are plentiful. ??You will never leave hungry. ??The staff is open to questions about where their food originated from before it gets to your plate, so don't hesitate to ask. ??Best time to eat there is Tues-Thurs and order the tasting menu, which is reasonably priced."
5,1,Good selection of Teas and Japanese Sweets. They are truly from Japanese owners.
1,-1,"I'm a visitor from London who had read great reviews about this restaurant so couldn't wait to drive the 45 minutes from Manhattan to Brooklyn to eat here! Got there - mouth watering - only to get to the door and see a sign saying 'Closed from 3pm-4:30 for the World Cup' - I looked at my watch and thought 'phew, it's 4:35, right on time!' - opened the door only for a Polish lady to rush over and proceed to say they were closed. Looking at my watch again, I remind her that the sign said closed until 4:30 and it was now past that.... 'oh I'm sorry, we'll probably open at 5 now' - she says. 'we're watching the World Cup' - she says 'sorry bye' - she says. Ended up going to an AMAZING restaurant instead about 5 minutes down the road, who took the initiative to have the game on so their customers could watch, eat and drink all at the same time. She was dismissive and rude too. No thanks! (P.S - Amazing restaurant was called 'Giovanni's Brooklyn Eats')"
5,-1,"Fantastic Restaurant! So to begin with, very easy in terms of transportation! ??I took the R train (don't take the D train or you'll end up in Coney Island before you know it!!!) and a few blocks later I saw the lights to this wonderful, comfortable looking restaurant on Prospect Avenue. The decor is lovely. ??It doesn't feel cramped, but still achieves a homey, warm feeling. The staff at the restaurant are super friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the menu, which is surprisingly extensive for such a new restaurant. I started out with the carpaccio. I love carpaccio but find that a lot of times it's either too chewy or too thickly cut. ??This was done to perfection ??with arugula, shaved parmigiano & capers. I almost ordered a second dish of the carpaccio but knew I had a lot more food coming. . . . which brings me to another point about this restaurant. ??The appetizers are a deal. ??Ranging from $8-$10, the portions are amazingly generous. ??Someone in my group ordered the sardines, which were delicious, and I couldn't believe the amount of food they received! I have to admit that I'm not a big risotto fan but apparently this place is known for risotto so I ordered the nero risotto with squid ink. ??Unbelievable. ??It was cooked perfectly and was actually pretty cool looking. ??The squid was tender. ??A+ Continuing to stuff myself, I had the tiramisu dessert. ??That was a highlight. ??Light and tasty, done to perfection. ??All the breads and pastas and desserts are made on premises every day. I will definitely be going back and am intrigued by pasta dishes and the steak, so I will be trying them next time. For anyone living in the area, a great neighborhood restaurant that also does take-out and delivery (there were several take out orders while we were there). ??Bravo Piccoli - Amazing meal!"
5,1,"Wow! Amazing food, perfect blend of hot and cold within each dish. My wife and I met up with her father and his wife. We were all swept away with the food, but equally as impressive was the staff. From the hostess to the wait staff to the management...hands down one of the most professional and mindful staff services we have experienced. Highly recommended! Come with an empty stomach, food is filling...enjoy!"
5,1,Wow. Really yum. Yum salmon salad. Yum eggs Benedict. Ok cheese grits. Homemade biscuits yum. Cool vibe. Q.E.D.
4,-1,This place is my go to place for lite Italian food and decent wine. I went here for probably the sixth time the other night and it was great as usual. The staff is very friendly and helpful if you're unsure of what to eat or drink. A great date spot.
5,1,"GBG as I think of Scarpetta - man its a great place! it deserves 5 stars - if they would offer take away by IV I would take it! Burrata check 5/5 Polenta check 5/5 Ravioli with fois gras check 5/5 Cavatelli with rabbit check 5/5 Fresh Linguine check 5/5 Branzino check 5/5 Chocolate cake check 5/5 2002 le macchiole cabernet franc for $87 check 5/5 Passito di pantelleria - (yumm) check 5/5 OMFG, call them until you get a table and go, you won't regret it"
2,1,"So, I ordered the buns and the spicy sausage and rice cakes.... The buns were mediocre at best, the sausage and rice cakes were good although the sausage was barely found, overall good flavor, not overbearingly spicy either. My friend as well ordered the same dish which was too spicy for his liking, the manager gladly took it back however never offered him anything to replace it with nor did they go through the menu as thoroughly as I would have liked. (I was surprised as the place was run by hipsters, although it was typical hipster hospitality aka none at all). The worst part of my whole experience was the next day... my stomach was absolutely killing me the entire day long! Never again... soo many better options, I was definitely not impressed with the service, atmosphere or food."
5,1,"I came to Tia Pol on a recent trip to NYC with my boyfriend, his uncle and a few of his uncle's friends. ??It's very small but has a great feel and the food was delish. ??This is where I had squid ink for the very first time, and, although I had a slight allergic reaction to it, it was heavenly. ??Be sure to get the roast piglet and the croquettes. ??Other stellar things on the menu are the razor clams and the blood sausage. ??I could definitely see myself here for a happy hour and not leaving for 4 hours because of good food, drink and ambiance. Great first date place."
5,-1,"Super knowledgeable staff. Impressive depth and range of knowledge about food, wine, drinks and how best to pair. Fresh healthy food expertly prepared. Ours was a group of five well traveled food aficionados and we couldn't have been any more impressed or appreciative for what certainly ranks in the top three lifetime dining experiences. Thank you GT staff for caring so much about your craft."
5,-1,"This place is just amazing for cocktails and comfort food. First of all, they have a chili infused gin cocktail called the Brooklyn Gin, super spicy (i LOVE spicy) and so delicious. And strong too, don't get me wrong. I want to try other ones on the menu but this gets me every time. That or the beers. They have an extraordinary tap beer selection. Something for everyone (although don't expect the bartender to know too much about them since they apparently change frequently) Also the food. SERIOUS comfort food with a delicious twist. I've had a few things on the menu, but I'm saving my calories for the day I can try their fried chicken BLT on a biscuit. Super cool place for the UWS, check it out for sure, and their neighbor Slightly Oliver too. It's nice to see this neighborhood expanding towards a younger crowd!"
2,-1,"low return on your money, that's how i can describe this place. Appetizers were ok but our entrees were disastrous and over priced. Rib eye steak was thinner than what I usually get in other regular places, cold, and full of fat. Semolina dumplings were bland and tasteless (please serve the sauce on the side) My friend's trout was overwhelmed from the extremely bitter arugula and completely lost its essence. even dessert wasn't done right. the soufle was good but the waiter without even consulting, went ahead and poured a very runny ""hazelnut sauce"" inside the soufle and that just flooded it and made it uneatable. wil never go back bc i know better places"
2,1,You can only get cold food before 11 AM. ??Cold food cold day leaves you ice cold. ??The receptionist/hostess was on the phone when we arrived for an interminably long time before she broke the news. ??Way to go. ??Keep customers waiting and waiting. ??Then deliver the verdict. ??No thank you. ??We left.
5,1,"I've been going to Le Grainne for years. In a neighborhood of overpriced mediocre food (and expensive delicious food), Le Grainne is a wonderful place to get a lunch or brunch without dropping your wallet. The mint iced tea is nice and I'm always a big fan of the make-your-own crepe. Everyone is always friendly and its a great casual french interior. It's also right across the street from Billy's cupcakes..."
5,-1,"Sought out Noodies based on the strength of Yelp reviews while in NYC. The great reviews were spot on. We were looking for great food, convenient location, and reasonable pricing. The first trip consisted of Mushroom Dumplings, Pad Thai, and Thai Fried rice a straighforward lineup that would tell the tale in short order. We found everything to be delicious, fresh and well prepared. I did this as a take out order and was pleasantly surprised with that very nice atmosphere of this small but stylish resto. The staff was very friendly and we enjoyed the first meal so much that we closed out our trip with a dining room visit. This time we had a couple of noodle bowls, again fresh clean flavors and excellent service. Very satisfied."
5,1,I have been coming back ??here lately for more when I crave for the Shawarma and its getting late I get the shih cheap & good and great late night snack the guys are great as well very nice to everyone
4,-1,"Great place, I love it!"
5,1,"SO GOOD. ??The pizza was delicious (we had spicy sausage and olives), and the service was prompt, polite, and friendly. ??I've lived in the neighorhood for three years, and I can't believe it's taken me this long to discover Peppinos. ??The decor and ambience is a bit lacking, but we will definitely be returning."
5,-1,"I am a regular at this unassuming homely little establishment. Juniper offers a refreshing break from the pomp of much of Williamsburg, paring down stuffy atmospherics to focus on making great food at a decent price. Staff are always super friendly and accommodating (last time I was there they were more than happy to move around half the restaurant to accommodate a group of 10 of us) and the owner himself will always take the time to have a chat. The burgers are phenomenal: very simple, really high quality meat and a great selection of cheeses, as are the spicy fries! Byob is a great money saver. Quaint little courtyard out the back where you can while away a balmy afternoon. I cannot speak highly enough of Juniper! If you haven't yet given it a go, it's about time you did."
5,-1,"I love this bar. ??I love it. I bring my colleagues from work repeatedly all of the time. ??We love the food, the atmosphere and are so glad that the place exists. But the main reason I keep coming back is because of two bartenders: Michael and Angela. These people have provided me and my friends with so much warmth, cheer, talk, laughs and understanding when times have been bad. ??Michael always makes my friends feel like regulars on their first visit. He is so kind and the type of bartender I would like to have working if I owned a bar. ??He loves the place. LOVES it! And his love for the bar comes across to his customers. Angela is always smiling, always so welcoming when we come in she makes us feel like family. ??We will keep coming back because of YOU!"
4,-1,"I went to El Almacen recently on a Saturday night and although it was a bit ??too ""cozy"" (as in the tables are very close to one another and it gets very crowded), I actually had a great time. The food was amazing. I had the Entrana steak and it was cooked to perfection. The truffle fries were delicious. And overall, the service was good. I would definitely go back."
4,1,"The atmosphere is great. Cute place, the outdoor seating in the back is really nice. For appetizers we tried: crab with avocado - good, but nothing spectacular calamari - delicious goat cheese and truffle honey bruschetta - tasty but not as impressive as I expected it to be after reading all the reviews. For entrees we tried: Gnocchi di Ricotta - must try, but I would recommend splitting it, after a while the cream gets too rich, I continued to eat it because I love truffles. Pappardelle al Ragu di vitello - really tasty, but a little on the salty side, but it's probably fine for most people. Brodetto di pesce - this was really delicious. Overall I would definitely come back here and try other dishes."
5,-1,"Went on a monday night with a foodie friend at the recommendation of friend who is an awesome NYC chef herself (Anita Lo, of Annisa- check it out & have the seared foie gras soup dumplings!). ??i figured Riverpark it would be great if Anita likes it, and well, ??we had a wonderful meal! ??We tried almost every fun cocktail they had. ??They all were very interesting, even if some aren't the prettiest in color. ??Try the Spicy Pickens! ??there is also a drink that is green but tastes like liquid bacon... it's ridiculous! ??as an app with our drinks we had the paella rice balls. ??they were sooo good. ?? ?? ?? Finally, dinner- We split the hamachi & avocado salad with a squid ink sauce. ??that was great. ??very light, and contains a perfectly balanced bite if you get each element on your fork. ??Next we split the Oxtail dish with the homemade pasta... YUM! ??tender oxtail, and deep flavor, but still light. ??Then I had the diver scallops & my friend had the duck breast. ??the scallops were seared perfectly and tender. ??I thought my friend's duck breast should have more crispier skin and the fat rendered more, but it had a wonderful flavor and was tender. ??We somehow managed to splurge for dessert even after all these bites... so we had a scoop of the white chocolate mint ice cream and the affogato, which is a layered light dessert of vanilla ice cream, espresso merengue ??and cocoa nibs and i forget what else, but it was great! ?? ?? We had a waitress who was in training, she did a great job, was very happy, attentive and recommended all the dishes we tried. ??Since we loved them all, we are completely stoked on the service, the bartending and the whole thing. ??their large garden on the block lets you know you are getting fresh, crispy veg and that is fantastic! ??a great place with a great view. ??our bill was high, but hey, we had like 10 drinks, and ate so much food, and for me, it was worth the expense for the treat of going to a great NYC restaurant & splurging a bit on cash and calories, ??so you will hear no complaints from me about the cost. getting there- just get to 29th street and walk east till you nearly end up in the water, and it's there on your right inside an office bldg."
5,1,"The only thing I would complain about is that I spent $80 on brunch! My friend and I got the Eggs Benedict and another benedict with mushrooms all marinated in red wine. Yum. The French Onion soup was phenomenal. There was SO much Gruyere cheese that that bowl, they may have just asked me if I wanted some soup with my cheese bowl. It was very tasty and I would definitely order it again, but share it. We came right smack in the middle of busy Sunday brunch time, but miraculously made it to the bar in only about 20 minutes. Thanks bartender for looking out giving our spot to us as promised. You made my morning! I also had ??morning adult beverage with lots of blackberries and tequila!"
4,-1,"Food was good, but atmosphere is very loud with annoying punk music blasting and waiters shouting all the time. My impression is that the reason for this is to make staying after your meal is done unpleasant so tables turn faster."
5,1,"Barrio Chino is awesome because: - Tasty cheap mexican food. - Excellent drinks- my fave is the Fresh Grapefruit Margarita. - Amazing guacamole, spicy salsa and chips - Great tacos and shrimp dishes - Beautiful waitress and cool bartender - Cool Vibe"
5,1,"My favorite restaurant in Brooklyn! Everything is delicious, I;m obsessed with the tostones!!! Can't wait to go back."
5,-1,i've been coming here for so long. I recently moved out of the neighborhood and miss bistango! they just (last april) completed a full renovation and updated the menu. This is the perfect neighborhood restaurant. Anthony is the best. Makes you feel as part of the family. chirs the bartended is hilarious too!
5,1,"The best arepas in all five boroughs, there I said it you happy? You can't go wrong with anything here and they have some of the finest green sauce you can find anywhere! Also be sure to stop by during happy hour and get a pitcher of Sangria."
5,1,Great food! Great Staff! Great Atmosphere!! Portions are HUGE so if there are just two or three of you order one plate!
5,-1,"I was so sad to see the old Jolie go. But as long as they have Crepes, my family and I will be very very happy and regular customers!"
5,1,"As many people have already noted, this is not a hidden gem, but it is still a gem nonetheless. My girlfriend and I arrived at 7:45 on a Friday and the place was jam packed. Luckily, the wait was a reasonable 10 minutes. The first thing you notice when you walk into this place is the fantastic smell of all of the great dishes that are being served by the friendly, but somewhat stressed, waitstaff. This restaurant is not romantic or fancy by any stretch, but it is really a urban delight...and I don't mean that negatively. There is something quite beautiful about watching the 7 train go by as you enjoy some wonderful chicken satay. My girlfriend ordered the vegetarian pad-thai noodles and I ordered the chicken with ginger sauce over rice. Both dishes were excellent and you get a ton of food for a relatively cheap price. We also had two thai teas and they were sweet and quite tasty. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive, but the place was packed and she looked like she was ready to close up and go home as she hastily counted her tip from a recently departed group. But this place is not about the service...it's about the great food and atmosphere...and this place has both. Parking in the area may be a bit difficult, but if you are patient you will definitely find a spot. After about 5 minutes of driving around a bit we were able to get a spot on nearby Roosevelt Avenue. Overall, we had an awesome dinner here and would highly recommend!"
3,1,"I found Meme after scouting the meatpacking district for some wholesome, authentic food. Meme satisfied my craving, it's one of those tiny restaurants that makes every dish with love. Their pita bread was soft and toasty and went great with their falafel platter. Can't wait to go back!"
4,-1,Food was good/solid
1,1,"After a disappointing brunch at Walter's, I've stopped by for the occasional drink given the quality of the cocktail menu and the close proximity to my apartment. However, last weekend was the last trip I will make. I've actually stopped in several times only to leave because there were no bar seats. This time, my friend and I decided to stay anyway. We each ordered a cocktail (average cocktail $12) and saw a couple people paying their bill and gathering their stuff so I walked over to grab the spot when they were done. As they left and I started to grab the bar stool, the bartender informed me that two people were going to be having dinner there. I looked around and saw two empty tables and stated to the bartender that tables were available, to which he responded ""are you eating?"". My point was that I could not sit at a table because I was not eating (fine, that's not unusual) but these patrons that are eating could take one of the available tables; why were they holding a bar spot when tables were available? I'm accustomed to a bar being first come, first serve. But I didn't get into it. I just walked back to my friend and continued with my drink. Shortly after, several more seats opened up right next to me. (It must have been my lucky night! Oh, never mind.) Just as I was sitting, the bartender just had to say to me, ""You can have that seat. This party just needs one."" I made some smart aleck response thanking him and continued to go about my night. Talk about a bartender on a power trip telling people where and when they can and cannot sit! He had no reason to say anything to me because the woman who was waiting got her seat. Now I've never done this before and probably never will again, but I was a few drinks in and decided to leave no tip. I wrote on the receipt that from my experience, bars were first come, first serve. Upon seeing this, the bartender continued with his haughty attitude and then asked if I would like to speak with a manager. I said that would be fine. While the manager was nice, he did nothing to change my mind (or my friend's), so we went on to one of the many other establishments in Fort Greene that knows how to treat their patrons with respect. I will not be returning (not that I'd be welcome)."
5,-1,Excellent food. Excellent service. ??Seasonal menu. Great ambiance. Original and fun cocktail menu. ??One of my favorite go-tos.
4,-1,This place is wonderful. ??Inexpensive and the food is very tasty. ??There is a nice bar as well.. ??Just moved to the neighborhood and I will be back.
3,1,"It really really was just OK. We were seated in the back of the restaurant where there was more space and TV. Ordered the mixed skewers with 3 chicken skewers, and two asparagus. The asparagus were burnt and the chicken tasted pretty ok. Nothing memorable. Next I had the udon noodles. It had the flavor, but it was too salty for me to eat. Just too much salt, what a bummer. The highlight was probably the dessert, which we ordered the dessert with 2 wafers, with a scoop of red beans and green tea and some fruit. The green tea icecream had alot of flavor. Everything fit together perfectly."
5,-1,"Love this husband and wife duo. ?? Their korean fusion is great. ?? Love the atmosphere, and how hard the couple works."
5,1,"Came here for Omakase lunch to celebrate my husband's 30th birthday- often been for regular lunch but not the whole shabang. Sushi was truly superb, they catered to our every whim- hot tea replaced intermittently, well spaced servings so as to enjoy the meal, anticipated exactly what we would enjoy, we didn't feel at all rushed and it was melt in your mouth heavenly sushi. Superbly prepared and unequivocally worth every penny! We had 15 pieces EACH- scallop, crab, squid, shrimp, eel, toro and rainbow trout were my favorite. $200 less tax with delicious mochi green ice-cream to share. They were so generous and treated us to a fruit plate on the house for my hubby's b'day. So impressed by the no tipping policy (in accordance with Japanese custom) in terms of how well they take care of their staff. Definitely sit at the sushi bar for the full experience. My favorite chef is Tatsu. Something very low key, minimalist, high quality about it which makes it irresistible. Couldn't say a bad word about it- you truly come out feeling like a better person :) Perfect for a special occasion, or if you just like to treat yourself mid-week!"
5,-1,"tomato sauce is perfect! the crust is perfect... worth the wait if you have to. go early and you should get a seat pretty fast. friendly staff. toppings are good quality. warm, cozy place... calzone is also amazing!"
4,-1,I am awake and will shortly get dressed and make my way to Clinton St. There is always a line at BEFORE THEY OPEN..grrr. But it is SO SO GOOD. I have been eating breakfast here daily for the last 3 weeks. My pregnancy cravings are thoroughly met here.
1,1,"You get what you paid for. I seriously don't understand why this place has 5 starts. They use the wrong bread, and it's not toasted. They use the cheap meats, or if there's any meat at all. My pork belly bahn mi was all fat with no meat. My grilled pork bahn mi had a couple piece of dry and flavorless meat. And it took them 15 minutes to make the 2 sandwiches. It's a great concept, but lacks quality. We left feeling ripped off and disgusted."
3,1,I ordered a lasagne over here. I would say it was pretty average. Nothing really great about it.
5,-1,"The most amazing atmosphere and best chicken satay this side of heaven. ??I totally recommend you try them out, and their prices are suprisingly great."
5,-1,Restaurant moved to 79 Mulberry Street........and the new name for the restaurant is H.K Wonton Garden
4,1,"The real draw to this wine bar is the nice outdoor seating area on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. ??The restaurant is situated in the middle of a quiet block on 52nd St between 10th and 11th Ave and it was really nice to sit outside on a nice evening. ??We got there at 6:45 on a Friday evening and most outside tables were full but still a few available. We tried a variety of appetizers and a couple of main courses and thought the appetizers were tastier than the mains. ??Of course, there's a large selection of wines by the glass and bottle. ??One thing to watch for is when we naively accepted the waitresses' recommendations for a glass of red wine and it turned out to be an eyepopping $17/glass. ??Yowza!"
5,-1,"I'm reluctant to write this review, because I don't want them to get too crowded! A great neighborhood spot. Cozy and warm, with excellent food."
4,1,"I know this place is mostly catered to those who love to stuff their faces with a meaty meat burger....but...I like to stuff mine with veggie veg burger. ??And, I'll tell you, this one is damn good. ??Especially with those homemade pickled jalapenos on top and a bottle o' Lone Star to wash it down. ??The chili is great too, and its also vegetarian. ??Stuff your face then walk down two doors to Great Lakes to drown yourself in booze. Addendum 3/26/07 ?? WARNING: ??DO NOT DOUSE BURGER WITH ""SMOKIN COON ASS"" HOT SAUCE. you know that thing where you puke a little in your mouth? ??yeah."
4,-1,"This is an old faithful for decent brunch on the weekend. ??It's a good consistent menu although I'd probably avoid the coffee (it's served in stainless steel glasses which detracts from the taste....). I eat here pretty often, it's a West Village staple."
1,-1,"TERRIBLE SERVICE!! I am an Asian living in California. I made a trip to NY and had lunch here. The female server was rude and provided terrible service. First, The server wore a straight face from the beginning. ??And there was a number before each menu item. I thought giving number would help to order instead of saying it incorrectly and said the menu number. Then the server sniffed at me and said that most people say the name of the item with irritated voice. During the whole dining she didn't come and check on me. I asked for more water, she didn't ??come back and I had to call her again. ??I think she wouldn't have treated me like that if I were a white person. She seemed kind to white people. ??I really regretted choosing there to eat. ??Don't dine there if you are non-chinese Asian in Chinatown, NY."
4,-1,AMAZING!!! Food was to die for or to wait for :) lol. I went there last week with my entire family which in total were 7 people- the wait was 1hour. I thought that was insane but my daughter convinced us that it was worth it. Wasn't I happy we listened to her. The waiters were a little cold and no personality but egh i guess thats okay. The food was so delicious and huge portions!!! Lemon Potatoes are amazing and the desert at the end was great.
5,1,"I finally got the chance to try Scarpetta tonight. ??We arrived for an early dinner at 5:30pm, and got a great table in the center of the dining room. ??Upon seating, our waiter brought us a bread basket filled with goodies...the star being their stromboli with melted cheese and salami......soooooooo good. We decided to order the short ribs and fritto misto for starters. ??The ribs were very tender and super tasty....the fritto misto was a great combination of fried calamari and veggies. Very light and full of flavor. For our entrees, we had their famous spaghetti, rabbit agnolotti and duck and foie gras ravioli.......all the entrees were simply outstanding with unique, rich, flavorful sauces.....but the spagehtti was soooooooo goooood and tasty......I could of have just eaten the stromboli and spaghetti and have been satisfied. For desert, we had the coconut panna cotta with guava and the chocolate cake with butterscotch gelato. ??The chocolate cake was great.....but the coconut panna cotta was just outfuckingstanding.....I came in my pants after tasting my first spoon. Throw in the excellent service.....and I had another fine meal w/ my babe! Scott Conant....You are the man!"
5,1,"This is my favorite cafe in the neighborhood! ??They always have something for me, whether I'm in the mood for a light bite or something sweet. Some of my favorite things include: cannele, mini scones, and their Moroccan merguez sandwich. For drinks- Moroccan mint tea, ??their herbal iced tea, lemonade and iced coffee. The owners- Amine & Tita are lovely and always friendly."
4,1,"Didn't know what to expect of Scottish food, but was pleasantly surprised. Had the cod, very well-cooked. Nothing spectacular but would go back again. Four stars is mainly for the Scotch selection, as would be expected. Had a wonderful tasting flight with dinner and the bar is great, though it gets really packed."
4,-1,"Teeny tiny place (and teeny tiny bathroom, but clean) with lovely ambience, but super loud. ??My husband and I had trouble hearing each other across the table. ??I can't imagine what a larger group would experience. ??That said, we had a lovely meal. ??Great service from the waitress and the owner (a woman -- which always makes me happy). The bread basket comes with oil & vinegar, which was surprising to me since I think of butter when I think of French restaurants. I had the goat cheese tarte appetizer (served with a small salad on the plate). ??It was quite large with a nice crust and a lot of goat cheese. ??My husband had the pear and blue cheese appetizer (also served with a small salad on the plate). ??His was super delicious! For my main course I had the small portion of the moules mariniere. ??I'm glad I had the small, as it was quite a large portion. ??I can't imagine what the large must be like. ??I was very very disappointed to discover that virtually all the mussels still had their beards. ??This is a dish I have had often elsewhere and I can't remember that every being the case. ??That said, the broth was lovely. My husband had the cassoulet and enjoyed it very much. ??It's quite a heavy dish for summer, but he was very happy with it. For dessert we shared the cheese plate: three cheeses (a soft brie, a semi soft stinky cheese, and a hard waxy cheese) served with soft bread, three slices of apple, and a teaspoon or two of jam. ??I did not care for the hard cheese (not enough flavor for me), but the other two were fine. A very nice experience overall. ??I would go back. ??I strongly recommend making a reservation. FYI: It's BYOB and cash only."
2,-1,Hate this restaurant. Only reason I give it two stars cos of the titanic dessert. Pasta is always under cooked. Even when you tell them to have it cooked more through. Wait staff is rude and snobby. All I asked for was a clean fork. ??Atmosphere was loud and noisy which is fine for time square but screaming children and fallen down drinks are needed ??no where ??near the dinner table. :(
5,-1,"By far my favorite restaurant in the hood. I've never had a bad experience at Walter and despite it being a tad pricey, I go back on a fairly regular basis. Great drinks. Really nice staff. Delicious food (to be fair though, I always order the Butcher's Steak -- why branch out when it's soooo good?)"
4,1,"Love this small, hidden, cozy gathering place. Definitely a place to catch up with your close friends. We didn't go for the tasting menu since we preferred ??to have oysters over the vegetable fondue. We pretty much ordered the rest of the tasting menu: Oysters were fresh, wagyu short-rib sashimi was very good, uni croquette was special and tasty, branzino was nicely done along with a lot of vegi in a large cast skillet and the uni & caviar rice bowl was lovely. Everything was good at Bohemian. Although I wasn't blown away by the taste of the food, the atmosphere definitely made up for it. This is a place that you want to go with friends and have a good solid meal. I will go back again to try their steak and foie gras soba."
4,-1,"First came here on my birthday... I wanted some pho because I was SUPER hungover from the night before. They didn't have any, but my friend and I stayed for noodle bowls and bubble tea. Everything is delicious, lots of circulation of people coming in and leaving, or staying just to read a little or chat. Fast delivery, too!"
4,-1,"Perfect for brunch, it can get a little busy but we could get a table rather fast by arriving at 11.30am. We had the florentine benedict which was very good, the salmon scrambled eggs which was great and the blueberry waffle with banana which was very tasty! All this for a very decent price! I highly recommend this place, and I will definitely come back!"
3,-1,"I ordered tacos from Los Tacos, They were good, quality ingredients but I do not think they were worth the price. I will not be ordering again"
5,1,"Food is unique and amazing. Cap 'n crunch chicken strips were great. Just enough sweetness with the carmel bacon sauce (yeah, you read that right). Brussel sprouts were more fried then I expected... but can't complain too much there. Chicken and eggos dish was unique and yummy, a little spicy which is good. And pumpkin butterscotch bread pudding was out of this world. Just be prepared to eat salad for a couple weeks afterwards."
2,1,"The food was ok.-- the atmosphere was suppose to be home-like but seemed more like a cheap Italian restaurant. ??The waiters seem to be rushing around and because of that, the service was lacking. I was disappointed, especially since it was priced more than the quality I was expecting."
5,-1,"LOVE THIS RESTAURANT! One of our favorites in the city. We've visited on several occasions and each time has been exceptional. Sit upstairs for a calmer, quieter experience. Downstairs is a bit of a madhouse. Delicious food, great wine, affordable prices."
4,1,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn. I usually end up ordering the fried oyster appetizer and absolutely perfect tuna burger, but have never had a bad meal over more than a dozen visits. BYOB makes it a great deal to boot -- get a couple bottles at the wine store on Union. Or a sixer of tallboys -- it's your meal, f*ck the haters. Also bring cash, since this is yet another place that subscribes to the BK anti-plastic philosophy."
5,-1,Back in Astoria tonight. Could not help myself had to do Australian again. ??The Thirsty Koala did not disappoint. ??Crab cake was delish.... ?? Spinach ??Goat cheese salad is very fresh and tasty. ?? Can't wait for my lamb lollies. ?? Love this place....
4,-1,Ovest has a large variety of pizzas and the are very good. The servers are also very friendly. I've been here quite a few times and am never disappointed.
5,1,"Lawrence - actually we waited for a good half hour because we came at 12:15 on a Friday. Had we come 20 minutes earlier there would have been no wait at all. ??Not much of a wait any other day of the week either. ?? I work right across the street from here and come at least twice a month. Everyone I've brought here from work and from out of town has loved the pizza. The old fashioned will feed about 4 people. The caesar salad is excellent and I crave it possibly more than the pizza itself, but the pizza never ever disappoints and I sit there saying 'this is so good' everytime. I once sat at the bar inside and when I went back to my cube I kept smelling something the whole afternoon realizing it was the smoke from the ovens that sunk into my shirt so be careful sitting at the bar. Any of the tables inside are fine, and if you sit outside with less than a party of 5 you will probably be seated at a picnic style table with other diners at the same table to conserve time and space!"
5,-1,"Love it, Love it, Love it! ??Hands down, the best place for sushi in Manhattan. ??My recommendations: ??fresh uni, saltwater eel, amberjack, extra fatty tuna.... ??Oh hell, just let the sushi chef choose for you!"
2,-1,"Ok so I've never written a yelp review before but I wanted to write one now. I figured my first ever visit to Catfish warranted my first ever yelp review. I went on a Sunday and I'll be honest- it was realllly nice to have a place in my neighborhood for brunch instead of having to brave sunday transit in to the city or, even worse, in to williamsburg. So, Location: good job. Ambiance: LOUD and i hate when a place has music *and* tvs adding to the volume level. pick one. Service: off and on. My waitress was super sweet and polite and attentive. I'm not sure if maybe she was all by herself but she was seriously hustlin. When i asked for hot sauce she magically produced it out of thin air in about 3 seconds. win. Bartender- totally ignored me when i went up to the bar to ask about a wine list. I guess maybe he was busy? It was sunday brunch, so ok. It might be one of those places where you get the best service if you're friends with the barkeep. ?? food: meh. it was alRIGHT but exPENSIVE for what it was. The poboy was good but i feel like i could have gotten it from a cart on the sidewalk (and not paid $12). The gumbo was kind of bland and the portion was not New Orleans sized. If a friend absolutely wanted to go to this place and it was her birthday, I wouldn't say no but I don't think i'll be a regular."
4,1,"Pretty awesome place--came here with a group of three others for their all you can eat pasta thing. Pasta was really good (not super amazing, crack-level though) but for the price and ambiance I would say it was pretty good. Annoying thing is that with buffets you usually expect variety, and here you're told that you start off with three pastas, so if you're very hungry and can eat a lot, this can get pretty boring pretty quickly. Nice ambiance but really loud. Not sure if it's because people only go to Italian places when happy or if it's cause of proximity to the theater district, but given the pretty decent amount of spacing between tables you otherwise wouldn't expect this level of loudness. Service was not bad but the place was obviously really busy, so they were a bit slow in getting to us."
5,1,"I've been here twice now and I am thoroughly impressed. ??Those who have left 3 stars or less must be out of their mind cynical. ?? Why this place is good is that it really delivers what few Brooklyn establishments do well: gourmet food done home style. ??The rabbit cooked two ways, and really served three ways (sliced breast, front & rear quarters, and stew), is delicious. ??A total value for two people because that's all you need to order. ??The sides and sauces that come with the rabbit are great. Good pickled veggies (though I'd prefer lacto-fermentation to vinegar) they get points with diversity of vegetables they use. ??Great take on hummus, refreshing salad, delicious bread. ??The small plates we had were the grilled radishes and fried cauliflower which are generally two relatively unassuming veggies, however they get proper attention here. ?? Highly recommended for ambiance as well. Very meticulous yet minimal interior design."
4,-1,"This place is so clean that I can eat off the table! ??Literally, the tables are shinny! ??Good 1st impression to whet my appetite. ??The service is good, waitresses are all very friendly and helpful. ??Foods are delicious with a great price. ??I felt the MSG after my meal, if they would get rid of the MSG in the foods, that will be even more fabulous."
4,1,"Excellent choices for seafood entr??es and appetizers. Ordered a piece of sole stuffed with crab meat and it was delicious. Generous portions, good service, and not too expensive"
4,1,"BIG PORTIONS! Maybe too big... but the food is always delicious, so I'm a fan! Cocktails are also superb. Want to go back on a Monday to try the 15-hour pork! Also, I love the ambiance. It's hipster-ish and they don't try too hard. Don't forget to get your $3 photo strip downstairs in the photo booth!"
1,-1,"do NOT go there. i went for brunch with two of my friends, and a little later i got very stomach-sick, and one of my friends (who tried some of the onion soup i was having) experienced stomach pains as well. i think the health department really needs to check this place out, as i noticed other reviewers mentioned having the same problem!! i also ordered the crepe au poulet et legumes, it was soggy, and it was a whole wheat crepe, which was not mentioned on the menu. ??my friend got the risotto...it was more like a rice stew that was swimming in sauce. the table was dirty when we sat down, the waiters kept on trying to take our plates before we were finished, and they even took away my iced cappucino (pretty much the only thing that tasted good) when i wasn't looking and before i was done with it. my two friends also thought there could've been MSG in the food because they both had headaches when we left the restaurant. this place is AWFUL."
5,-1,"Print never disappoints. The chef focuses on local produce, so the menu will change with the seasons. The bar menu needs some updates, but the selections on the restaurant menu are varied and include vegetarian options. The kale salad was great, with apples and toasted pine nuts. Also tried the duck and the pork chop, both were well seasoned and cooked perfectly."
5,-1,It is impossible to have a better food !!! the best place in queens by far!!
5,-1,"The rumors are true!!! I have been wanting to have breakfast here for at least the past year. But I couldn't deal with the weekend lines. I had Monday morning off so I decided to finally visit. It was amazing and totally worth it. Just the aroma when you walk in in satisfying. I had the pancakes and there is nothing to say. They were excellent. Light, fluffy and beautiful to look at. The only quibble I have is that the tea was just so-so. Tazo or PG Tips would have been better, but it doesn't matter. Go on a weekday."
4,1,"Coming from California, of course I'm obliged to mention In-N-Out. For both, I've eaten inside as well as had friends deliver it to me, which produces quite different experiences. Here's what I think: Price: A Double-Double costs $3.20 (may vary by location), while a Double ShackBurger will set you back $7.20. Given that New York is definitely not 2 times as expensive as Califonia, there's no comparison here. Advantage: In-N-Out. Buns: In-N-Out buns are toasted. Best thing ever, especially the first bite which sticks out of the wrapping paper making it especially crispy and delicious. But given improper handling (e.g. one time my friend threw several boxes of burgers in the back of his car and drove 30 minutes to get here), it can quickly turn into a mushy mess. With Shake Shack, the buns are designed to take grease, and the more that gets soaked in the better. Advantage: In-N-Out for eat-in, Shake Shack for take-out. Meat: Both are better (and I think more fatty) than most other fast food places; you need all that greasy goodness to complete the taste. But Shake Shack patties are slightly thicker, allowing them to retain more juice. Advantage: Shake Shack. Cheese: Not a huge difference. Tie. Vegetables: In-N-Out has a whole lot more vegetables on top, giving it a very fresh taste. Again, don't wait too long because when you have something cold on top of something hot, the laws of thermodynamics dictate that the system will try to reach equilibrium. Shake Shack pales by comparison here. Advantage: In-N-Out for eat-in, Shake Shack for take-out. Fries: In-N-Out has regular-shaped fries while Shake Shack makes them crinkle-shaped. In-N-Out also has animal fries which beats Shake Shack's cheese fries hands down. Advantage: In-N-Out. Variety: Shake Shack just has so much more stuff on its menu, such as hot dogs and the SmokeShack. Advantage: Shake Shack. Customization: What In-N-Out lacks on its printed menu it makes up for in its secret menu, such as 3x3's (three beef patties and three pieces of cheese; you used to be able to order any number of patties and cheese in a burger, but now you're limited to 4x4), animal style, protein style, etc. You can also specify how well-done you want the fries. Advantage: In-N-Out. Beverages: Both have good milkshakes, but Shake Shack has a wider selection including beer and wine. Advantage: Shake Shack. Sauce: This is what really does it for me. Just personal opinion, I can't really explain. Advantage: In-N-Out. Overall, I think I'll stick with In-N-Out, but Shake Shack is still an amazing burger place. 83/100"
3,1,"The Mac and Cheese is great and a reasonable price. The actual restaurant, however, is...weird? From whaling hooks to gothic lanterns, I just don't get it."
4,1,Unfortunately I'm writing this review very late. I was here almost a year ago. Anyways I'm going to keep this simple. Brick oven pizza is always the way to go when u can. The pizza here is really good and I do plan on going back again. The prices do not reflect your average pizza spot but this is not your average pizza spot. If you find yourself in the area you should definitely atop in and try their pizza. It's really good!
5,-1,I recently visited this place and I have to say it's worth going into and eating their food. ??It's delicious with the strong coffee they serve.
4,-1,Best burgers! Love this place. And they have yummy cocktails too
5,1,"I came here once for their dinner. It was great. But I just had their brunch prix-fixe and it is fabulous! I got the Mushroom Omlette with cheese and home fries and Greek Salad. The prix-fixe came with Coffee or Tea, and fresh squeezed OJ, or Mimosa. It is only $12 but they gave you a lot of food! My boyfriend got the caramelized Apple Pancakes, which came with tons fresh apples, blueberries, and melons. He couldn't even finish his plate."
5,1,"Rock solid, been coming for years. Recommended highly for lunch, when you can get interesting specials you can't get at dinner."
5,1,"I love bahn mi so much that I know a good one when I eat one! I use to think the bahn mi from Bahn Mi Saigon (at Chinatown) & Thanh Da (at 7th avenue, Brooklyn) were the best. ??But since a co-worker recently recommended me to try a bahn mi at Ba Xuyen, ??I came to the realization that the best bahn mi is made at this place. I ordered #8 (Grilled Pork, cost $5), and an avocado shake ($3.50). The grilled pork bahn mi was extremely delicious and full of flavors (grilled pork, cilantro, shredded pickled carrots & radish, mayo & peanut pieces in it). The baguette was so soft and crunchy. It was so damn delicious, I felt like I was in bahn mi heaven! I loved it so much, I went and bought a 2nd one to take home. The avocado shake was very tasty, and it complemented the sandwich very well. Highly recommended! Get your bahn mi on at Ba Xuyen!"
4,-1,Food was very good and well presented. ??Staff very friendly and professional. Would go back again.
5,-1,"Best meal of the winter! I dined at Prospect last weekend and was just blown away by the entire experience! ??Exec. Chef McClelland used to be Sous Chef at one of my favorite restaurants at home so when I was in NYC I knew I had to try it... it did not disappoint! 5 of us arrived for a 7:00 reservation and were graciously greeted by the owner Steven and a lovely hostess- the decor is so cozy and comfortable, but still very hip and elegant. ??If I lived in the city it is certainly somewhere that I could see myself being a regular. We started with cocktails (very fun list!) and some wines by the glass. ??We later moved onto bottled wine with dinner and Steven was so helpful and pleasant with our wine service! ??Our server (Christoper?) was delightful! ??Very friendly and knowledgeable- he was there whenever we needed him, but we didn't feel as if he was lurking about. I would have loved to have tried the tasting menu (and certainly will next time), but after having eaten our way through the city that day my guests were not up for it. ??We did have the green salad and the Nantucket bay scallops and both of those were fantastic! ??I personally enjoyed a special of Sweetbreads... my favorite! ??They were wonderful! ??For entrees we had a variety of menu items, all wonderful. ??I was particularly impressed with the pasta dish- one of our party is doing a post-holiday vegan diet and we were all thrilled when the pasta that he ordered was just as good as the rest of our more ""meat and dairy"" heavy entrees. ??While after my sweetbread app I probably should have gone with a lighter entree, I just couldn't say no to the cassoulet... with the foie gras supplement... OH MY GOD! ??My mouth is watering just remembering it! ??After entrees we had some port and some sort of puff pastry with melted cheese and salmon roe... I can't even really describe exactly what it was, but we were all just blown away by how delicious it was! ??And finally, as if we hadn't stuffed ourselves enough we had to try dessert... all of them! ??My favorite was the deconstructed s'more... elegant and tasty, with whimsical hints... so good! ??The cashew ice cream and olive oil cake were also huge hits. I really can't say enough good things about Prospect- I'm so excited that I was able to get in there and I will certainly make it a priority to return the next time I'm in NYC. ??Kudos to the front of house team and back of house team, our experience was flawless!"
5,1,"This is a cute, informal cafe that serves an excellent variety of Indian and Chinese type foods. It is extremely reasonable and even more importantly, delicious."
5,-1,"This is honestly one of my favorite restaurants/cafe. I always always always order the Milanese panini. It's soooooooo good. I'm carving one as I'm typing this. I love the pesto sauce, the tomatoes, the chicken cutlet, the panini bread, and everything (even though I've listed everything in the panini, including the panini itself). I honestly suggest you to try the Milanese. It's small for $5 but it's so delicious, it's worth it. I've tried the dessert with nutella (sorry, I forgot its name). It is delicious. It's $1, kind of small, but so good."
1,-1,We spent nearly $800 on our tab here and the bar was good until someone stole my brand new pants - just paid $215 and they were still in the shopping bag. ??Not a good crowd obviously!! ??Be careful of your property here!
5,-1,"OMG... I am in love with Kobeyaki... it's my new favorite restaurant.... prices are reasonable... portions are generous.... tuna tataki salad is amazing... kobe burger is out of control delish... spicy tuna roll, california roll & shrimp tempura roll have a few unique twists and are incredible. ??Next time I go, I'm going to try the soft shell crab bun. ??It's clean & has a cool atmosphere. ??Even my very, very picky 7 year old loved it. ??And the cinnamon buns for dessert were a perfect way to end a perfect meal."
5,1,"Great spot! Cheap drinks, board games, and free cheeseball....swhat more do you need to have a good time?!? I came here on a Saturday night and really had a good time. There was a great low key vibe, good music playing from the jukebox, and like I mentioned before...cheap drinks and free cheese balls. If I lived closer I would definitely be a regular, but since I don't live close, I'll have to try and stop by again when I'm in the hood. Its def not a bar for everybody becuase its pretty divey, but it suits my style well. Full disclosure: if you have a beard you will probably get service at the bar faster than a pretty girl. I do not have a beard nor am I a pretty girl so I think I was passed over a couple of times for service at the bar, but after so many cheap drinks I didn't care."
5,1,"I love pizza. I love this place. I had the Hellboy. WOO HOO. So fresh out of the oven, Mike's hot honey is ON POINT. The Sopressata Piccante gives it a kick, but it's manageable. The hot honey isn't too bad either. Definitely recommend. I've only been once so I've only had this one, but freshly made to order, I'm pretty sure everything is just as delicious. There's lots of options so I'm sure you'll find one that suits you."
5,-1,"Since everyone is posting about brunch (which is obviously wonderful) I will post about dinner... I LOVE coming here for dinner, either with a few friends or with my boyfriend, and even by my lonesome. Half price wine (average bottle being $16) definitely draws me in, but the food is so delicious! I love ordering Mezes, especially when I can't make up my mind, they are a fun ""try a little bit of everything"" meal. The Bronzino is probably my favorite fish dish, and if they have the Lamb Shenk special next time you go... GET IT! yum! Oh yeah... something a lot of people might not know is that they serve Lunch on Fridays that is almost exactly the same menu as Brunch, and way way way more low key. Also the lunch menu has Mezes on it and the brunch menu doesn't :D"
4,-1,"Because the restaurant itself is on the small side, there is always a wait during peak brunch time. If you hate waiting, I suggest you go to brunch at an off-peak time. That said, the service and food at Northern Spy are always excellent no matter how crowded it is. Side note: Tip your server nicely. They really do work non-stop during brunch hours. I highly recommend the sake bloody mary, the buttery biscuits to start and the kale salad with eggs. The menu is a little on the pricey side, but it's worth it if you are looking for something beyond the usual coffee, bacon and eggs."
4,-1,As a guy who lived several years in France I've seen all the so called french made c*ap in the city. However Balthazar isn't that. Not in the least! This is the closest you'll get to a parisian brasserie feeling. Staff is attentive without being all over you and their chefs are top notch. Be prepared to spend more than usual though as it's quite expensive.
4,1,"Oh the neighborhood bar of the West Village! As described by preceding reviews, this is a great date or an after dinner place. Best date nights: Sun-Thurs because it's not as crowded and music allows some conversation to seep through. Menu: Mostly beer (tap and bottle) and about 10 different wines (changing constantly) In the summer, there's one bench outside for the lucky 5 or so who will snag it first or you can affix yourself to the people already there and make new friends."
5,-1,"Bone Marrow and Oxtail Marmalade.....top 5 things to eat in NYC under $20!! I would just come for this, the oysters, and a bottle of wine. ??Amazing! I would only recommend getting it from the one on Sullivan St. Columbus Circle Oxtail is slightly different and not as good."
4,1,Love this place. Food is always good and its always busy. The live music was a bit too loud last time I came with my parents. So have to knock a star off for that. Also the wait time on the entrees aren't super fast. But I love everything about this place. Sit and enjoy. And order the oxtail.
1,-1,"Service here is terrible if you're not a pretty girl that the bartender seems to be trying to hit on. ??Sat at the bar for 10 minutes while watching the bartender talk to girls, people who seemed to be his friends, and a group of pretty girls. ??I mean he told us twice he was was going to be right with us then went back to talking to everyone else. ??He seemed super drunk, or it coulda just been how he acts. ??Pretty sure he was drunk though, saw him taking shots with all the pretty girls. ?? Finally got our order placed. ??Don't remember if there were any specials other then the shot of well whisky (or maybe a step above) and a Genny Cream Ale for $7. ??Not a very good deal if you ask me seeing as how people in Rochester, where Genny is brewed, don't even drink that swill. ??Ordered it anyway because I couldn't stand having to wait for the bartender any longer. Moving onto the end of the night. ??You should know this bar closes at 1 for neighborhood reasons. ??If you plan on getting a drink make sure you listen for last call. ??They don't yell it so if you're not at the bar you probably won't hear. ??If you don't hear it then you're S.O.L. unless, and you might have guessed it, you are a pretty girl or the bartenders friend. ??Tried to see if we could place a quick order seeing as how he was still handing out drinks but we were not privileged enough to get any last booze. If you haven't figured it out I am not a pretty girl nor do I know the bartender, but if you are either of those then you might have a better time at this place them me. ??Give it a shot, you never know."
4,-1,my fav
5,-1,"Wow - they have so many reviews and they deserve it! This is my go-to for great Japanese food in NYC. Stellar food presentations, great service, amazing saki selection!"
5,-1,"This is an amazing spot to go for Thai food! I was introduced here in April, and have gone back as much as I could since. That was the first time which I had tried Thai food, and I'm so glad I did. The second time I went here, I was with a fairly large group, but the staff was more than accommodating. Price wise, they are really phenomenal, and you get a lot of food for the price. Each time I go I walk out satisfied. If you're in the area, definitely stop in for a bite, you'll absolutely be glad you did!"
5,1,"Loved this restaurant. Everyone working there was very friendly & knowledgable. ??The owner even checked on us multiple times. The food was AMAZING...I had the Flounder & my boyfriend had the Lobster Risotto (a special that evening). We also had the Calamari for an appetizer & it was soooo good! The atmosphere was also very romantic. In a city full of such amazing food, I promised myself I would never go the same place twice, but we will definitely be returning. Compliments to the chef !"
1,-1,"I really enjoyed having dinner at the Rabbithole every now and then. Yesterday my girlfriend and I walked up to the restaurant and the chalkboard outside said ""foie gras"". We turned around on the spot and we're never coming back. Vegans and vegetarians who mean it, be warned. I'm disgusted."
4,1,"If you want to go to an authentic Japanese cafe in NYC, you should go to Cha-An. I had a lunch special and matcha there, and it was excellent. (Eel donburi was super good!!) I went there several times on weekend, and it was too crowded that I couldn't get in. It is too bad that place it too small!!"
5,1,"Consistently fantastic, always worth the wait. ??For intimacy and lack of traffic, I suggest you ask to be seated upstairs. ??Also ask not to be seated in the back. ??The one time I wasn't a typical girl and wasn't annoying/extremely specific about seating, I was placed in the back. ??I explained to the waitress that I didn't enjoy hearing the toilet flush or the line of people. ??She ""explained"" that some people don't mind. ??I informed her that I wasn't one of them. ??However, she wasn't intending to be hostile, just wasn't competent. ??Usually their waitstaff is quite charming. Nothing beats their eggs benedict for brunch and their delicious free mimosa often leads to a few that aren't free."
3,1,"The arroz caldo was amazing. The bangsilog was a little meh. The fish didn't have much seasoning and I had to pour on the vinegar to get some good flavor in it. Also the garlic rice with the silog was a bit too mushy for my taste. If it was a bit dryer the rice, I would have loved it even more. But the hosts and bartender are super friendly and I'm sure this place will do incredibly where there's a great need for more filipino food!"
4,1,"For an off-Mulberry St. Italian restaurant, this is a gem. Friends had Chicken Milanese and spaghetti bit the real treat was my Kale Caesar Salad and Gnocchi with Gorgonzola and Spinach was the star. The staff was friendly and the chef available for any questions."
5,-1,"he menu has zero non-seafood options, and all of the seafood options are fresh, clean, and feature the fish. The fish entrees are cooked to perfection and the sauce and veggie parings rock the house. The Soft shell crab sandwich was delicious, they stuff two soft shell crabs between some sort of bun and laced it in green sauce really delicious food here. ."
5,1,sometimes in life you get surprised...by a combination of perfect service ...Food with so much flavor and taste and the perfect cocktail to touch your soul. We had a bit of a wait but everything after that was perfect ..right from the attentive service to the food. And oh the ambience is great. . A star is born is all I have to say.
1,-1,"This is really shameful I have to write this review, but after having continuously dined at Alta all this time, we took our family to Alta one night and explicitly told our waiter we would only order from the nut-free menu (which apparently didn't occur to the waiter that someone at the table has nut allergies). ??Anyway, after just a dish or two, my fiance began to feel ill, and it turned out that pine nut remnants or oil or whatever it may be (presumably cross contamination and carelessness with managing utensils/dishes/pans in the kitchen) affected his dish (of tomato mozzarella, mind you -- no nuts) and he immediately began to have a severe allergic reaction. ??We had to use his epi-pen and all had to get up and leave dinner so we could rush to the hospital and save his life. ??Eight traumatic hours later, we were released from the hospital. ??My fiance's sister who put the dinner on her card called the restaurant that evening to ask if we could get our money back and to explain the situation, and the manager HAD THE NERVE to actually yell at her, no offer to pay her back and even told her it was our fault that we never informed the waiter we are allergic to pine nuts. ??Seriously Alta, shame on you and your poor management. ??I really hoped this would be the one place that we could eat without any concerns, but apparently not. ??And for those of you with food allergies, even though they do have gluten-free and nut free menus, don't take it seriously, because apparently Alta doesn't either. ??And their attitude is pathetic, considering we were going there every week for months at this point and they certainly must have had some record in their system and, if not, that's just pathetic customer service."
4,1,"The food is very good here. Traditional chinese far. We ordered the edamame app, beef with broccoli and chicken friend rice. The basics after all I was traveling with a 7 yr old and an 18 yr old. The beef was amazingly tender! They do not have egg rolls which was a bummer and portions were small. But the prices were cheap and it was just enough to not have left overs. Service was fast and the place was very clean. I would go back."
4,1,i love how you don't get overwhelmed w/ the food. this is such a great alternative to conventional breakfasts. you'll leave knowing you did your body right. ??i just dont like the salad that comes w/ it sometimes. best morning meal is definitely the grits. the water is also served from a wine bottle which makes it taste extra good! oh and don't forget to get a side of goat butter maple toast.
5,1,"Went to Uva last night on the suggestion of a coworker for a great Italian place...We shared several appetizers; the wild mushroom bruschetta, the eggplant rollatini and a cheese plate. All were very good- especially the truffle oil and chili cheese. For entrees we ordered the scallops wrapped in prosciutto, the lemon sole and the pesto cavatelli. Again, everyone was very pleased with their entrees. The pesto cavatelli was creamy and perfectly al dente. We also tried the sparkling red wine served in a bowl...not sure what the name was but saw it on the menu and had to try it- very interesting! Would highly recommend for a neighborhood Italian dinner!"
4,-1,"worth the wait, YES. ??but the amount of people outside makes the experience slightly less pleasant. ??you are not rushed by the staff, but there is nothing leisurely about 50 people staring in the window drooling at your most delicious plate. ??is there a time without the wait? ??please, do not list this gem in any other tour books, PLEASE."
4,1,"We came here on a Friday night, it was not too crowded and the ambiance and the decor of the restaurant was really nice and unique. We got their pork belly which I thought was really tasty and their shrimp rolls for appetizers. I got the Basil Fried Rice and thought it was really good. Good Vietnamese / Thai restaurant. Not too expensive either."
5,1,"First time I've had a bite of the beef bulgogi sandwich was at midnight. My boyfriend brought it home for me. It was a little cold and just a tad but I didn't mind because it was AMAZING! it was juicy and flavorful, not at all what I was expecting of a cold old sandwich! I went back the following weekend, ordered the same sandwich with fried egg and kimchi fries on the side. OMMMMM! definitely will be back again...and again...and again! FYI - take one of those frequent eater cards, you'll get a free sandwich or two ;)"
5,-1,good place deff recommend ??to any one looking for a decent meal
2,1,Overrated. Service decent. Beer decent. Food decent. Seating was uncomfortable. Cockroach stalking my date...not cool.
5,1,"I've come here on two occasions, and was impressed both times. The ambiance is very elegant, and almost glowing--I found myself enjoying conversation with my date that much more because of it. The staff seems efficient from a patrons perspective, and servers are all very well mannered. The best way to describe service would be professionalism, without that impersonal and pretentious, off putting vibe. I love the crust, this place is definitely worth the train ride out to Brooklyn. 5 stars."
5,-1,"yum yum yum! Thank you Marlow & Sons! Yet again you have made my day wish you perfect (yes perfect) cappuccino, and deliciously flakey croissant. Too many wonderful things here. Really, too many. I kinda wish I could put my bed here and just live around all the wonderful yummy things."

5,1,"Our first night in New York City and just had a lovely meal at Caffe Linda. ??Grilled Salmon was crispy but cooked perfectly - great combination of texture and flavour. ??My wife had the Lasagna and ate every last bit - quite a rare event for her. ??Can't speak high enough about our experience. ??Also had the Peach Sorbet and the Panna Cotta for desserts followed by Coffee. ??Everything was fantastic. ??We're only in New York for 6 days, but we will be coming back here before we leave."

1,-1,"I'm conflicted because I don't think there are less stars to describe my experience. I arrive at the place, get in line for a table and hit the bar to wait for my friends. I waited for 45 minutes to be seated and six other parties that came after us were seated before we were. I walk up to the hostess to find out what's going on. She's on the phone so being courteous wait for her to finish the conversation. She hangs up, I launch into a sentence, midway the phone rings, she raises an index finger ""One moment"". Being courteous I wait for her to finish, she hangs up, I launch again into a sentence, the phone rings, an index finger is raised.......you get the drift. I remind her that I'm waiting for a table and she asks me if everyone in my party has arrived. I wait another ten to be seated and finally giving up decide to eat at the bar. ??Since when does a hostess take roll call before sitting you at a table? What if one of your friends cancels? The only redeeming quality was the service from the bar tender Carly-masterclass. After the dinner was over, not trying to get someone fired or to be confrontational, I pull the bartender aside and tell him in the six years I have dined in this city, this was a new low for me. The ambience was nice, the caesar salad was good but my appetite was gone. Its even worse because everyone else gave a stellar review, seemed to have a good time at the place and cared enough to give a compliment."
5,1,"If you want good pizza, this is definitely the place to go! It was the Saturday night of Memorial Day weekend and we had a wait (short but worth it!!!) We ordered the Caesar Salad (yummy) and the Arugula Salad that had goat cheese and walnuts (OMG, I couldn't get enough). We ordered the No. 2 (cherry tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, garlic and sea salt) and the No. 3 (mozzarella, sausage, broccoli rabe and garlic) pizzas. Crust was to perfection, toppings were plentiful and taste was unbelievable. And if that weren't enough, we had to taste the Brookie Bridge with raspberry ice cream made especially for Julianna's from the Brooklyn Ice cream place just down the street. No matter how much you eat, ??you have to save room for this little treat. It's a brownie cookie sandwich with this raspberry chocolate chip ice cream in it. To die for!!!! The place is cute and you can even sit and watch them making the pizzas and see the oven it's cooked in. Well worth the trip from New Jersey. Will be doing this again real soon and I suggest you do the same! You won't be sorry."
4,-1,"This place is solid. The food is on point and the decor is clean, simple, and adorable. The atmosphere is pretty nice as well, with the theme very much feeling like a actual Japanese room. The service was not bad. Could have been a little more expedient, but nothing worthy of a real complaint."
5,-1,"I love this place!! The food is yummy, the drinks are creative and reasonably priced. The ambience is warm and comfortable. I like it here. :)"
3,1,It's decent. ??Not the most exciting flavors. Mostly I'm here to plead with the owner to start serving Pho at dinner time!!!!!
4,1,This is one of the best restaurants in the east village. The service is good but the food is spectacular. Not watered down but inventive and delicious. I genuinely think this is one of the best places in NYC right now.
2,1,"Given how crowded Cafe Henri was for Sunday brunch, my friends and I decided to check out Open Door across the street. The first thing I noticed upon entering was how empty it was on a Sunday afternoon. Nonetheless we were initially satisfied with finding a place for us to sit down, eat, and catch up. I ordered the set of three sliders - duck, beef, and pork - and a side of fries. To be honest, the sliders were quite bland that even the mayonnaise and sauces could not redeem the flavor. The sliders were presented with their buns to the side such that I could not tell which bun was assigned to which burger. Each bun had a different condiment and I forgot the menu description, so it wasn't an easy match-making process. The fries were too soft that it seemed as if they were microwaved from frozen. My friend ordered slices of lox which were salty. The general consensus among my friends was that the food was mediocre. I would not go here if your primary goal is to get a well made and tasty brunch. However, if you do want bottomless brunch for $20 (which at that point food quality is not a major concern), this is the place to go. Perhaps this is more of a happy hour joint? I'm sure it's better for drinks."
4,-1,"The food was awesome and the drinks was amazing, I definitely will come back again. The salmon is amazing if your looking for seafood. I tried the mac & cheese which is also good as a appetizer. I came from happy hour and the drinks weren't bad. The view by the water was spectacular. The service was great & music was very good"
5,-1,"I had always heard about Eight Turn Crepe. I am in love with this place. Their crepes are to die for. The fruits are fresh, everything just worked well together."
2,1,"Paulie G's- ??The envy of every white collar Italian in the Tri state- Paulie G went from making copies to making crust- he went from serving the greedy to serving ingredients. He overcame the incessant call to the office and now makes pizza- fairly well. ??Well as most of you know, the story goes Paul made a brick oven in his backyard which evntually turned into the restaurant. He specializes in the smaller pies, made famous by, well, almost every little ""pizzeria"" popping up in trendy areas. It is becomming redundant to venture into one of these pizza restaurants that attempt to retain the beauty and unforced simplicity of the Pizzeria, yet fail in both regrads. Concoting unique variations for pizza is easy when a delicious combination is conjured and set aside a round spate of bread- but is it pizza? Just becuase arrugula and assorted greens and vegatables taste great when arrainged in this order, does the final product constitute a pizza? lets go back to one of the original questions of (italian-American) mankind- what is a pizza? ??If it was up to Paulie and restaurants the eclusively serve up this rotund snack (lets call them smallpie shops)- pizza would be anything that can be placed upon a a yeast ridden wheat treat in a centifugal, yet not necessarilly radially uniform, array. Well, actually, im not buying it, (well ill try it once to see if my saucy instincts are incorrect since I have developed an aforementioned keen intsinct whereas I can taste the pizza by a simple gander at any pizzeria storefront withing eyeshot). So now for the pizza- Always start out with the most simple, or most similar to a ""regular"" american pizza- in this case, as in most, the Margharita. well, at first glimpse I was dissapointed, and and second glance I could already taste the Motorino like disspointment infiltrating my tounge....but at first bite- I was surprised. Quite a bit more tast than those other guys- Specifically the fresh Mozz was very tasty. ??Sauce- nothing too great- Ive had better gravy from gramma (no suprise here), but still below average compared to the upscale pizza shop. Greenpointer- suggest by Paul himself (who is a extremely amiable and I wish great success in this industry and whom Im sure will gain said success becuase his products, albeit at times un pizza like, is always very tasty) Is an unpizza worthy of tasting becuase it is excently dressed with greens. but, BUT the biggest dissapointment, and one I was hoping Paulie woudlnt succomb to, is the bread and crust. ??the problem with these wood burning ovens seems to be leaving the pizzaiolo with, if not an instantaneous soggy doughy bottom, one that quickly morphs into it. This pizza is no different. The result is a pizza that must be treated like the vegas showgirl you met at the Venetian. Utilized post-haste, and never re-heated (aka What happens in Greenpoint, stays in Greenpoint)"
1,1,"Service is horrible ... Took my order and told us 20 minutes later that the chef isn't there and was maybe coming in ten minutes ... This review is not about food, it's about service"
5,-1,"Joe installed an outdoor Tantenna on my house in Brooklyn, NY. ??I found him helpful, professional, efficient, courteous and knowledgeable. ??Not only that but he was on time. ??And he even called me the next day to make sure that everything was working properly. ??I will certainly call him again for other projects. ??I can't recommend him highly enough!"
4,-1,"A friend of mine, who knows that i will go a long way for good tacos, recommended this place. Since i was in the area, i was there withing 15 min. Now, it was one of the coldest days, (28), but the line of people, made it clear to me - you are in the right place LOL The Tacos were just the way tacos should be: simple, fresh, right amount of ingredients (that those of you who likes tacos know, that the mix of the ingredients, is what the Tacos taste so good). People, try El Bronco Tacos. They worth it!"
5,-1,"Very pleased with our evening at Bistango. They accomodated our large group very well, the staff were attentive, friendly and helpful, including the owner who was a pleasure to talk with. Wide variety of gluten-free options were great. Thank you!"
4,-1,"I can't count how many times I thought about this place while I was living in Japan. ??The ambiance is very cozy and feels like a piece of history. ??Just looking at the well kept hardwood floor, you can see that this place has been here for a very longtime. ??The menu and specials are written on chalkboards hung on the walls. The food is great here, my party and I ordered the Penne Alla Vodka and we all agreed that this was by far the best version of this pasta dish we have ever had. The pasta sauce was super creamy with a nice taste of basil and packed with sausage and melting mountains of cheese. ??The penne were nice and firm and not over cooked. ??There were three of us and this dish was so big, we could not finish it all. ??We couldn't even order dessert, which was one of the reasons we came here, because we were told that this place has a real good tiramisu. ??We ended up having to come here another time just so that we could get it. ??Be advised, the portions here are HUGE. If you are ever in New York City and you are in the mood for Italian, I highly recommend coming here."
5,1,"What an amazing delicious Italian treat nestled on a quiet tree lined street. ??We came in on a Friday night, and were able to grab seats at the bar with no problem. ??Our bartender/server, Giovanni, was amazing. ??He started us off with some lovely bubbles, and helped make recommendations for some great starters. ?? There wasn't calamari on the menu, but he checked with the chef and had some made especially for us. ??The handmade fettuccine bolognese was the highlight of the evening for me. ??I can't wait to eat here again, and will definitely request Gio!!!"
5,1,"Highly recommended whether you know and love polish food or are a total NOOB. ??My friend and I both got the Polish sampler platter. ??wowzerz, what a great place to start with this joint! ??Kielbasa, stuffed cabbage, pierogies, mashed potatoes, and this kinda weird but really tasty slaw type dish that i think had meat in it. And just a heads up, it is pronounced ""WOMZ-ski-ANKA""."
2,1,"Went here for brunch and the food was pretty good. I just wish the stocky and rude host didn't leave me with such a bad taste in my mouth. Wanted to give the dinner menu a try the other night but again, the host was agonizingly rude, dismissive, and unprofessional. We ended up just walking out and going to another restaurant in the neighborhood with better service."
2,1,"Super-duper cramped, very noisy, rather hot and altogether someplace I will never return to. ??Three persons not allowed at a table for 4, but herded towards a table for two with a chair pulled up. ??I didn't appreciate that one bit and insisted on sitting elsewhere, much to the host's disdain. ??Pizza was no big deal, salad was overdressed. ??Wine list was okay, but not the kind of place where I'd care to linger. ??More of a wham, bam, get the check ma'am."
4,1,"Very good thai food. Great for vegetarians. Also, some really cool and interesting cocktails."
5,1,Bistango is by far my favorite Gluten Free restaurant in NYC! The service is always amazing! The owner is so friendly walking around introducing himself and loves to hear your story for choosing his restaurant! Now the food is delicious! Let's start with the bread it's the best gluten free bread I've ever had! All the pasta dishes are to die for and the dessert won't let you down. :) I have nothing but great things to share about this place! I am a returning customer and will continue to return! If your gluten free and are either visiting the city or from the area you MUST check this place out you won't be disappointed!
5,-1,Love this place ! I am a regular customer there lol ??I fell in love with Kobe burger. Thsi is a definite winner ! and sweet potato fries- out of this world. and plate with rice/salad and beef/shrimp - amazing ! I guess the secret is in the sauce !!
4,1,"Darling, I don't feel like we are on the Upper West Side anymore. Large open floor plan, communal counter height tables, an inviting bar counter with awesome bar chairs, a menu full of fried and gravy smothered dishes, totally dug this country bunk of a place. I guess they are known for their pickles but their biscuits are not to be missed. Banana Pancakes. WOW. I think Jack Johnson is on to something as I wanna pretend that it's the weekend everyday and eat these. So damn good. They were dense, biscuity, and oh so heavenly. I will probably frown the next time I'm served a light and fluffy pancake. Super indulgent so I would share this one folks. Biscuits and Gravy, oh my, these might just be the best on the east coast thus far. The gravy, the gravy.... The grits were a little too thin for my liking but still enjoyable. A few squirts of their housemade hot sauce kicked these grits into full yummyness. You can never go wrong with the greatest bacon ever, Niman Ranch, even when they over cook the shit out of it. Mine was beyond overcooked but damn was it still fantastic. I wanted to love their homemade sausage patties more but they were not doing it for me. I actually would have preferred them if they were thinner. They were tough when trying to cut with only a fork and lacked any fattiness that sausage should have. Service was great, the vibe and feel of the place was right up my alley. Brunch was a hit so you best believe I'll be back to try dinner."
1,-1,"thank you roberta's for the huge pile of garbage that appears on the north side of moore street in the MIDDLE of the goddamn sidewalk in varying size and configuration every night when i walk home from the morgan L every night (see photo). your garbage pile is so meticulously and strategically placed so as to not to obstruct anyone getting into - or out of - a manhattan-bound Uber, or anyone who lives WEST of of your restaurant. after all, the only people who live east of bogart off of moore street are black or hispanic and probaby live in the projects at the corner of moore and bushwick avenue."
4,1,"The restaurant is small. ??It has tables that are crammed together, so to get out, you may need to shuffle tables around. ??The wait can be very long. ??I came with my fambam--there were five of us and we all fit, though I was elbow to elbow with my cousin and my hubby. ??When the door opens, you most likely will feel a rush of cold air, as all the tables are somewhat close to the door since it's a small place. However, we had a wonderful dining experience. ??Part of the reason was because of the company, but the food is delicious! and decently priced. ??It is CASH ONLY. ??I recommend the potato pancakes with smoked salmon (~$12). ??This dish is amazing! ??The potato pancakes are very savory, topped with sour cream, capers, green onions, and smoked salmon (or ham, depending on which you choose). ??They give a nice modest portion of salad between (if I remember correctly) 5 potato pancakes, each the size of a person's palm. ??The eggs benedict is pretty good too. ??As a side note, the home fries are actually mashed potatoes, but they are delicious! The fresh squeezed orange juice comes in a small wine glass, but is apparently delicious."
1,-1,"This place truly is the worst dining experience I have ever had in NYC; which is especially pertinent because poor dining experiences in this city are a rare occurrence indeed. As decent Greek restaurants are somewhat difficult to find in New York, unless one travels to Queens, I was tempted to select this Manhattan venue by virtue of its decent rating and high volume of reviews by the some 1500 diners who seemed all to have had a positive experience. However, I was most displeased from the moment I opened the front door of this establishment. The venue itself is completely different in real life as to how it appears on the restaurant website. The pictures displayed on the website portray a quaint Mediterranean, traditional Greek whitewashed and blue vibe. The decor on the website is presented as understated, chic, traditional. It looks like the kind of place you would want to have a romantic meal and a bottle of wine over a candlelit table in the corner. There is even a ""The Kefi Story"" tab detailing an almost Telenovella style history of the restaurant and its owners and of how prestigious and well-received this restaurant seemingly is, of which the press section of the website bolsters these claims. In stark contrast to the website, the reality is a restaurant interior which is shabby and sad, displaying rubber lined floor mats, fraying edges, diner style accommodation and over-population by staff in tacky uniforms. The decor is not what was displayed on the website AT ALL. It looks like a completely different establishment. There are 3 TV screens broadcasting sports to patrons at a pub-style bar, where they hunch over mediocre-looking meatballs and pitta with dips. I honestly thought that perhaps we had gone to the wrong place, and again checked the address on my reservation app on my cellphone in case I had had a bout of early onset dementia and had inadvertently gone to some inferior Kefi restaurant, or its diner subsidiary. But it was affirmed that although I had been deceived by the website portrayal of what my evening at Kefi would entail, I had in fact arrived at the right place. As I looked around at the teeming crowds, and buzzing staff, I couldn't help but think that despite the restaurant's obvious grottiness, that all of these scores of diners couldn't have possibly erred in their judgment of this place. It must be the quality of the food that they have come for. Perhaps the initial new-restaurant gloss of the decor has worn off with so many bums on seats, and that this is now a neighborhood favorite, the frayed edges actually a symbol of how well-trodden the path to Kefi is.....so I ignored my gut instinct to run for the hills and decided to stay and give the place a chance. I tried to relax and be open minded and embrace the 'rustic' charm. We ordered. Lamb shank with orzo and I opted for Rabbit pappardelle. My guest's lamb shank was freezing cold and had to be returned to the kitchen for heating. But essentially it was bland, and the simple orzo accompaniment lacked creativity. The dish was so dull. My rabbit pasta looked like something that had come straight out of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares. What should have been a delicate and delicious dish had been transformed into a lasagna style (served in an oven dish from hence it had just come), grilled cheese and crispy onion fries topped disaster. It was gross, and featured some miniature rabbit bones. Oh and my wine glass was grotty. The only salvageable aspect of the dining experience was our server, who was prompt, attentive, helpful and probably embarrassed by the lame fare that he is tasked with transporting to the tables. Guys at Kefi, I think it's time for some intervention. Someone please call Gordon Ramsay."
5,-1,"I can't imagine anyone coming to Oscar's for breakfast, lunch or dinner and not feeling good about the food & the spirit of the place. It's reassuring that the west village still has at least a few places left that are one-of-a-kind in a warm, fulfilling and in an unpretentious/not-trying-to-reinvent-the-wheel kinda way. (Or reinvent the waffle kinda way either, one of their specialities). One of the first sings of spring for me is when I see a couple of rows of tables set out on Hudson street, and it thrives during the good weather seasons, but never seems so crowded that you can't find a table. The restaurant is a world onto itself, and there's a whole bunch of neighbors I see there at certain times almost like clockwork. Neal, one of the owners of Petite Abeille, which was there for years, had the sense to buy the place from previous owners, ??and then name it after his son. He has two partners, both of which worked at Petite. And, ??while not sacrificing some of the kinds of dishes Petite served, the new owners infuse a new sensibility into it. Neal, btw, ??is one of the treasures of Hudson street. He knows everyone and his mother, and their kids and their dogs, and hekeeps his humor and warmth up effortlessly (as well as his teasing and in-jokes with the regulars). And his partners (one of which is the cook) are very different in temperament but equally first class: warm, caring and consicientious. In colder seasons, when the outside tables have to vanish: ??the vibe changes a bit -- quieter, more romantic, but still filled with yummy stews and steaks. Fries are killer, omelettes my favorite around. I'm not sure if they still have some of the nightly specials but they were great. But on a spring morning or summer night, sitting out there, watching neighbors and kids and dogs and tourists go by, you feel so happy Oscar's is part of the hood. Hope it stays there for a long, long time (or at least when Neal's five-year old boy hits, say, 30 and decides to take it over)."
5,1,Now I never liked falafel since the first time I tried it. Man I tell you these guys changed my taste buds around! ??It was my first time so I went with the chicken platter even though there were other two platters that caught my eye. ??The chicken was very flavorful!
4,-1,"The food was good but definitely sit upstairs for a quiet dinner, and the butter lettuce was incredible ."
2,-1,"Amazing sandwiches, catfish and steak sammys are my fave.. the corn is delicious and their custom fruit salad is off the hook- NOTE: usually a line outside, during the day service is great and friendly, at night however the cashier is very unfriendly not helpful, waited for my food while it sat in front of her and had to ask her to see if it was mine and it was, got it cold :( not appreciated."
4,-1,Well designed and well lit fun Thai staple in HK. Large portions for a Thai restaurant. Their tuna tar tar is famous! The service was helpful and accommodating. After all these years this place is still great!
5,1,Very amazing place with substantially good staff. Favorite is their pork bun and gyoza. Definitely genuinely enjoy their food. Keep up the good work...
5,-1,This is the best sandwich shop in New York! The roasted cauliflower is worth crossing town for.

3,-1,been here a few time. first time writing a review. ??good Pizza bad service.. get it together
5,-1,"I've been here many many times over the past 9 years. Generally I end up at Jane for weekend brunch. A girlfriend and I have a slight cheddar grits addiction, which Jane always fulfills well. As a lover of eggs benedict with scrambled egg whites as opposed to eggs sunnyside up, I usually order such and am always pleased. Tonight however, I had dinner at Jane for the first time in quite a while and it was fabulous, thus inspiring me to finally write a review. We started early at 6 (lame but we were hungry) and were pleasantly surprised to find an unusually quiet atmosphere for Jane, which was great. The soothing decor was also much more noticeable with the restaurant less bustling. Our charming and very attractive waiter made several great main course suggestions and also encouraged us to indulge in some appetizers. I started with the special chilled asparagus soup with lobster nuggets and raw radish which was delightful and refreshing. The grilled octopus that we shared was deliciously juxtaposed against a bed of spiced chickpeas and shaved tart spicy cucumber. For main courses, we had the Goat Cheese Ravioli with pecorino romano, pink peppercorn sauce, and tarragon, the Diver Scallops with porcini mushrooms, and the Roasted Chicken with fingerling potatoes. All were exquisite with the ravioli probably being the best of the bunch. However each dish presented an interesting array of textures and flavors far exceeding expectations based upon reasonable prices. If not assumed already, I find Jane to be a NY highlight in the mid-price range. Definitely recommend."
3,1,Cherry Cosmo: delish. Truffle Fries: tasty. Burger with fresh avocado and alioli mayo: mediocre.
3,1,Split the pork sandwich and noodles with a friend; both were good but I would stick with a sandwich and a coconut bubble tea in the future.
4,-1,"THREE things to know about Junior's: 1. YOU GO HERE FOR THE CHEESECAKE. They have all kinds, so that's what you order. (ti's delicious, and so was our cutie waiter, Armand.) 2. IT""S CRAZIER THAN BETTY DAVIS IN PLAID. This place is busy. BIZZ-AYY!. Expect to wait for a table, honey. 3. YOU TOURIST MONSTERS NEED TO LEARN TO TIP! I watched this awful table run this poor, handsome waiter around all night. And then a waitress helped clear his table and looked at his checkbook and said, ""That's the third table that did that to him tonight."" That poor man. There but for the grace of Maude go I. I used to wait tables back in the late 70s and if someone had done that to me, darling, I would turn into a Mamet character in no time. With the screaming and the cussing and the whole thing. ??Like John Malkovich in every movie. It's a wonder the staff doesn't spit in their food when they see these tourist people coming. Go for the cheesecake (incredible) and learn how to behave. This is New York City, not Kansas, Auntie Em and Uncle Henry~!"
4,-1,"Nice to find this place on the hell's kitchen last night. The ""room service pad thai"" we had was nicely presented and tasty. Love the ambiance, they even have Christal chandeliers displayed in the middle of the restaurant. Very chic. Will go back if i get a chance."
2,1,"I heard great things about this place so I gave it a try, and my experience was a disappointment. ??The waitress was very arrogant and unwilling to help and to compromise. ??The tom yum soup was very salty. The thai ice tea was too sweet that I still couldn't drink even after i put more ice and water in it."
5,1,"Less than a month in, and for my money this is the best restaurant in West Village. Yet another reason to come to NYC, and it's close to The Jane. Been here two days in a row."
3,-1,"The cici bean soup was terrible if it wasn't for the soup I would of raated this place wit 5 stars. The main course and dessert was amazing, breath taking."
5,1,"best ramen in nyc. recommend getting the tutto spicy ramen with poached egg and spicy bamboo shoots on the side. the wait is long, but this place is worth it."
4,-1,"Probably the best Ramen I've had in New York, loved the Ippudo Special Ramen. It's amazing that their boiled egg is always perfectly salty and liquidy-oozy in the center. The broth was also delicious on it's own. $13 for Ramen may be a tad steep but considering the location and comparable food you can get in NY with $13, this place is definitely hands down worth the price. The only reason why I am not rating this place 5 stars is because of the wait. The hostess indicated about half an hour for two but it really turned out to be ??an hour."
5,-1,"Phenomenal falafal. ??Can't speak to anything else on the menu, because I can't tear myself away from the falafal. ??It has the ability to make a bad day good and at $3 it really is one of the best deals in the city."
1,-1,"Early on Roberta's was a great affordable choice in Bushwick. Now it's a pretentious hipster enclave. The service used to be semi decent. Now it's just a pizza place frat house with inattentive arrogant staff, horribly loud music and not to mention the same amount of bathrooms prior to expansion. This place's time has passed move on."
5,1,"I go to Ellary's Greens for breakfast nearly every week - it's become a ritual of sorts. Brian and I always have a great conversation and the food is unbelievable - I am a big fan of the eggs with the gluten free wrap and a smoothie. Lunch and dinner are amazing too - I stop by for chicken, the quinoa/kale, and the bacon anytime I'm nearby (if only the delivery zone was wider, I'd order here for every meal!)."
5,1,"Pizza is good. Cold beer is good. Barboncino has both. They have several kinds of each, from the basic (though thoroughly delicious) like margherita and peroni to the more adventurous like cherry stone clams and a seasonal local brewery offering. You can have your pizza on the cheap (about $15), or you can team it up with appetizers like white beans and pesto, or cheese/meat boards and drinks to make it thoroughly fantastic. The service is always bubbly and attentive. The cocktails are stiff. The dough is fluffy, crispy, and stretchy all at once and in all of the best ways. Probably my favorite place in the neighborhood."
5,1,For 5-6 dollars this place is really good. The soup isn't salty. The noodles are really crispy and fresh. I definitely recommend the beef soup noodle and fried dumplings.
4,1,"Nice bistro with a back patio for the summer. First time I try peruvian cusine. Service prompt and nice. Fair prices, good portions. Tried 5 dishes, all pretty good, there are still many I would try next time. I would go lighter with garlic and onion but maybe it's the peruvian style, don't know..."
2,-1,"What is the deal with this chef. I have seen him on TV and also met him at scarpetta one night. This guy thinks he is the shit, he is such a douche. Big deal cause you put butter in your spaghetti . As for the crudos you should leave raw fish up to the Japanese .Merea does everything better than scarpetta."
1,-1,"Given the option in Bed Stuy to do or don't dine here, I'd opt for don't. If I wanted to eat deviled eggs, drink a rolling rock, and blast Jay-Z to a conversation killing volume I would prefer to stay home with leftovers from last Sunday's softball potluck-- and I wouldn't have to wait 45 minutes, or have to consider a $3 Rolling Rock a novel treat. Perhaps it was a moment of poor ordering, but my octopus taco was lackluster and inferior to most New York taquerias, the nachos tasted like frozen gyoza expertly pan fried , and the E666, besides being fucking obnoxiously titled, failed to pair rich and salty flavors in a way that was more than the sum of their parts. Honestly, this restaurant is one of the more over rated experiences I've had in Brooklyn. The food was whatever..., the wait was long, and Do or Die's hyper cultivated image reeked of a swaggering pretension that borders on offensive. Given all the dining options in Brooklyn, or even all the dining options one has in general in this world in a lifetime, there's no reason to make this restaurant one of them."
5,1,"I came here for the Dry Aged C??te de Boeuf 2 years ago, and it was by far the best piece of steak I've had in NYC. I salivate uncontrollably to this day whenever I think about the thick slices of bone-in ribeye, paired perfectly with the roasted bone marrow. I definitely scooped out the marrow and used it like butter on my steak. This time I came back for lunch to try the infamous Black Label Burger. At a hefty $28 price tag, I had high expectations. Minetta Tavern once again delivered a solid 5 stars. The Black Label Burger earned its reputation for good reason. Imagine a fine piece of juicy, succulent steak. Now imagine that fine piece of steak ground up and grilled, topped with caramelized onions and sandwiched between two lightly toasted brioche buns. Yes, that's right. I paid $28 for expensive ground up steak, and it was delicious. I savored every single bite of the burger and immediately wanted another one. The fries that came with the burger were a-ok, crispy and thinly cut like McDonalds fries. Don't let them distract you; focus all your attention on the meaty prize. The restaurant is fairly small and remained busy all throughout lunch. Despite the hectic atmosphere, our waitress was very attentive the entire time, You'll definitely have to make reservations in advance, especially if you're trying to come for dinner (which is the only time they serve their C??te de Boeuf!)"
4,1,"Best lychee martinis in the city! Great bar in the lower-east side just north of Delancey. Great ambience, food is decent (get the dumpings, skewers), crowd doesn't get out of control.. the drinks are what you go there for, the bartenders are a great bunch."
5,1,"Amazing. Like tasting menu, fine dining amazing. The service was excellent and they pour nice full glasses of wine (i dont like measured pours). Get the gnocchi its to die for. i live in LA and i cant stop thinking about it. After dinner we took our glasses of wine to the roof top bar, it was a sunday so it wasnt crowded, and enjoyed the amazing view of midtown and the nice atmosphere. When in NYC i will def go back."
4,1,"Aside to the Asian bartender who was quite curt at the bar and then being out of the red wine we ordered at dinner, everything was excellent. We had a nice slow paced dinner at a cozy booth. The owner was quite helpful and made suggestions. We enjoyed a 4 course dinner of our choosing trying Octopus, Market vegetables, Suckling pig, Bucatini, Short Rib and Hake, all delicious."
5,1,"Just like everyone said, the tacos are awesome. The Hot sauce is indeed fiery, not satly like most american restaurants. If you don't like intense heat, get the medium. If you do like it realy hot, as them to put the sauce on your meat first so it doesn't burn your lips."
5,1,"I have visited Sotto 13 a few times now. ??It is a lovely place to meet a friend for a glass of wine...(def try the mushroom pizza, it is as good as everyone says it is!) and I discovered last time that it is a wonderful place to have brunch, too. ??The food is delicious and the Prosecco bar is so much fun! I will be back again Check out their review on nycmemorybook.com/consum?£á?"
3,1,Still a great burger but everything else is an overpriced standard. Nothing exceptional. Snooty service - both at the bar and at tables. Strayed from the pack and ordered the fish - 2 perfectly seared end cuts that tasted completely rotten. Sent back. Manager declined to taste it but said I was wrong - but did take it off the bill.
5,-1,"The place has a good ambiance. Certainly very romantic, incase you are looking for a place to take your date out this holiday season. The food was good, especially the pho. If you have somewhat of a sweet tooth like I do, I highly recommend the spiced apple cake. I walked in around 7 and the place was packed, so definitely make a reservation for dinner if you don't want to wait 30 minutes like I did. The server was friendly. He recommended the drink Fig-a-tini for me, which was good. All those didn't cause me an arm and a leg like many other places in Manhattan would. That is always a plus. Bottom line, I will definitely come back."
4,-1,"This place do live up to the hype. The noodles and the fried dumplings are some of the best I've ever tried. The price is cheap - 11 fried or steamed dumplings for $3. The space is really small, cramped with lots of people and can get loud and obnoxious. You can watch and hear the guy pulling and banging the noodles, fresh right next to where you sit. I have to say it is somewhat a good experience. I was satisfy with the meal, the reason I docked a star is mainly because the place is a little grungy. The food is good enough for me to come back at another time."
4,1,"When I think of Turkish and/or other Mediterranean food, I usually picture some little hole in the wall restaurant, but this was not the case with Beyoglu. ??When I first walked in at 8:30pm the restaurant was completely packed with a wait time of 40 minutes for a table. ??Luckily we made reservations so I just walked upstairs to our party. ??There isn't much ambiance per say, but it has a little bit of an upscale feel. ??To start we all shared a plate with various dips (hummus, babaganoush, tzatziki, spinach, some couscous kind of thingy and something else that I have no clue what it was, but was tasty). ??With the dips they gave you giant pieces of steaming hot fresh bread, which was soooooo gooooddd (hello carb overload). ??I had the Beyoglu salad for dinner, which was really nothing more than a house salad with chicken and lemon vinaigrette dressing. ??If I wasn't going out afterward I probably would have opted for some lamb or something (my friend and her boyfriend shared that because the portions are huge and it looked delicious) but I didn't want to be in a food coma. ??If I lived in the neighborhood I'd probably come here quite a bit."
5,-1,"I enjoyed lunch with friends here yesterday. ??I ordered the Cuban Sandwich..... because if there's a Cuban on the menu, it must be tasted. ??I would rate the sandwich alone 5 out of 5 stars. ??Pulled pork was juicy, tender, and delicious. ??The fries on the side were also a tasty treat. Everyone was more than satisfied with their meals. ??It was also a friends Bday, and he enjoyed some delicious chocolate cake and ice cream!"
5,-1,"Loved this place! Exactly what West Village side street restaurants should be. This place may be 'tight' on space but that adds to the charm. lots of unique decor. The menu is fairly simple, and not vegan-friendly but something with more French brasserie flare. Great variety of French wines, try one of the soecials by glass or botttle! Enjoyed a tasty Agremont on this visit. The starters are focused mostly on bread topped with cheese and other items, such as the goat cheese and sundried tomatoes which was tasty. The mains were so delicious! Coq au vin (chicken) was to die for! And the cassoulet equally tasty. For both, the meat was tender and fell off the bone. Portions were small but sufficient! Dessert was nice and simple, an apple tart that matched well with a glass of sauternes. I would definitely go again. By the way, no reservations that I coukd see and you may have a wait. Not ideal for large groups since it is a small venue. Well worth a visit! Great FRIENDLY and attentive service, even when they are super busy!"
4,1,"Family brunch. Sleepy baby and hungry 7 year old made me question this selection. The hamburger special was just perfect. ??Asked for pasta wih butter for baby, and got ??it. I loved the mushroom lasagna!!!"
4,1,"Burgers, Mac and cheese, Fried pickles... drool, drool, drool. We came on a Tuesday night and, while it wasn't packed, every table was taken (at first... luckily, one became available about 15 minutes after we arrived.) I started with a Rye Root Beer, which basically tastes like a spiked root beer; delicious. The pickle martini was interesting (I've actually made this at home before because McClure's - the pickles they use - actually has the recipe on their jars... but, of course, SF makes 'em better). The spicy margarita was too sweet originally but I asked them to adjust it a bit and then it was good, has a slight kick with each sip. We shared a burger and he said he could make a better one at home, but I liked that it was simple - just lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle - but well cooked and reminiscent of burgers you'd grill when you're having a BBQ. The mac and cheese is fantastic - served in a hot skillet, super cheesy (cheddar, muenster and gruyere), but not overly so; get it with the bacon, it adds a nice smoky flavor. The fried pickles were also delicious; nice, light batter and spicy pickles (heart McClure's!). It's served with a ""smoky sauce"" that was yummy; I dipped the French fries that we ordered in it also. Cool ambiance with dark wood and exposed brick. They appeared to have a good selection of beer too."
4,-1,"Frites just as I remember them in street stands in Bruxelles. Quick and to the point.. There are benches in back with slits into which one inserts the Frites Cones. I confess to a fascination with their machinery. I station myself in the back so I can hear the deskining machine and the chopper and see parts of them through the door. AS for the FRITURE, it goes without saying that its good. A regular cone is more than adequate."
4,1,"Came for pre theater dinner and ordered the pasta special. The meal was great especially the roasted beet and goat cheese ravioli. The service was exceptional and they have a large selection of wines under $25 which is very cool. The only thing that reserved me from giving Becco 5 stars were the table arrangements. We felt quite cramped, luckily the people on either side of us were very friendly. However, I can see people who are more private not liking that."
4,1,"The only restaurant that I have ever been to where they played The Mars Volta. Oh, and the food was really good. And the service was excellent too. I would definitely go back. Cause I'll never sleep alone."
1,-1,"Don't need to bother going there. Unless you are not hungry and have too much money to waste. In this place, almost nothing is right. Trust me, they forced you to order for 2 people, hot pot, but it's not even enough for one, and it's not even half good as the shabu shabu we ate elsewhere. the ??only reason I give one star is because the green tea ice cream at end which come w/the order is very delicious."
5,1,Went here for a light dinner of Tapas and loved every bite. The staff is excellent and the service quick. ??Particularly enjoyed falafel encrusted artichoke hearts and of course the Sangria!
3,1,"Walking around the Bowery in the middle of the night earlier this summer, we finally stopped and tried Pommes Frites. His plate: regular fries, truffle aioli on the side Her plate: regular fries, sweet chili on the side, roasted garlic mayo on the side Honestly, we were a little disappointed in the flavor of the fries. The texture was great, but after a few fries, the potatoes started to taste a little off - a little dirty. The sauces are definitely what make the experience - but make sure to get two contrasting ones, so you can switch back and forth. I liked the fries more than D did, and I credit that to my two very different sauces. The roasted garlic mayo had a nice real garlic flavor, with no tangy raw garlic edge. The sweet chili sauce was sriracha mixed with what tasted like a citrusy vinegar, and was pretty decent - nothing amazing, but a good contrast. There is a notorious line here - but they serve pretty quickly, and it's pretty good people-watching while you wait. It's pretty touristy, and we've had better fries, but it was still fun."
5,1,"We dine here every week. this is our favorite dinner haunt in NYC (but ??we are biased as we do live around the corner). Their whole fish is divine- it reminds me of the seafood one can have in the Dalmatian coast.. The place is a unique, idiosyncratic ambiance that transports you to Europe. ??I don't want to publicize this place too much as I want it all to myself... but I want them to do well. Thumbs way up."
5,-1,"Food was delicious, served by attentive and friendly staff in a wonderfully minimal yet cozy atmosphere: The variety of dishes covered the spectrum of food groups, with no craving left untended. Everything was cooked excellently and creatively. I especially enjoyed all the textures paired together to really add that extra something: crispy skin on the juiciest guinea hen I've ever tasted, light yet crunchy beet chips with a tart yogurt atop creamy hazelnut mousse sprinkled with some lightly sweetened toasted oat granola--among many gems. If you're looking to have a food adventure, this is the place to go. Also, the chicken fat-baked bread was perfection. Some reviews are saying the portions are too small, but maybe they're just used to oversized American South portions--I was happily full and did not feel the food guilt or need to unbutton my pants that I usually feel after a delicious meal. I thought $55 was very reasonable for a 5-course meal. Well done, Jeremiah and Fabian! Can't wait to come back!"
5,1,Loved the food... Staff is beyond nice and a great wine selection... Would definitely go back.
4,1,"Service with a smile. Good quality food; am sure to go back! Also, you can skip the cronut line at Dominique Ansel to eat one of their ""doissants"" which was pretty good. I'd recommend a night visit; we were there in the daytime and the place is terribly dark for the winter; it's really my only -ve point here. They've done a great job of making the place feel personal even though its deep and tavernous and actually quite big."
1,-1,"All I can say is WOW, and not in a good way. Went for a big group birthday dinner and after 2.5 hours we decided to cancel the rest of our order (the majority of which still hadn't come out) and cut our losses. While there's a host of mind-bogglingly epic fails that I could bore readers with, I think the highlight was when I desperately asked our overly-verbose and underly-helpful waiter for some bread to prevent passing out after only having been served a few pieces of balsamic-soaked broccoli over the first two hours. The response he dutifully passed along from the manager who one hopes will not be a manager for very much longer was, ""I regret to inform you that all of our bread is reserved for our sandwich."" ?? I couldn't make this up people. Stay away, some things just weren't meant to be and this pretentious side-room of Urban Outfitters that calls itself a restaurant is one of them."
4,1,"I ordered for delivery only, never dinned in. Whole chicken, tamales, sea food, fried rice, soup... are all delicious and offered in generous portion. Tostones are dried though. Deep fried plantain, on the other hand, are crispy around the edge and gooey in the center. This is a gem around NY Penn station."
5,-1,"With fresh, delicious fries and over 30 sauces to choose from, what's not to like? The space inside is a little cramped, but it's doable. Delicious, and so many varieties of sauces...plus the staff is always friendly and will even let you try different sauces before ordering!"
1,-1,"Me and my boyfriend trusted the high ranking of this place on yelp. Unfortunately, food was disaster. I tried shepherd's pi and my boyfriend tried burger. None of us was even able to eat half of what we got due to lack of quality of the ground beef used on both meals. We couldn't guess it could be that bad by looking at prices either because burger is $13 and pie is $18. Only positive thing was the ambiance. This pub is really cute in design, cheap but cute. I suggest do not buy anything which has meat in it. Actually, I remember their half burn horrible fries now and change my mind if you want to eat something just go somewhere else."
1,-1,"I just got off the phone with a surprisingly rude delivery rep. I have Celiac disease, which means I can't eat gluten and I just found out that a couple of Mexican restaurants in the area have corn tortillas that contain gluten (which is news to me), so I called to ask if Guerro's tortillas were or were not gluten free. The first person I spoke to was male and was extremely unhelpful. I asked him if the tortillas were gluten-free and he told me he assumed so. I asked if he could make sure. He left and ??came back on the lines shortly and told me they were gluten-free. I asked if he was sure. He said I had asked him to find out and he had asked someone and he didn't know what else there was that he could do. I said it is as simple as reading the package. He said oh, okay, in a sarcastic tone of voice, put me on hold, and a few minutes later a woman came on the line who told me the tortillas were gluten free. She was quite pleasant about this, until I asked her if she was sure and she also got defensive, saying that there was nothing on the ingredients list about flour so unless the ingredients list was wrong there should be no problem with the tortillas. I apologized for my overly-cautiousness but explained that it's a very serious allergy and I just wanted to make sure. I then proceeded to ask if I could place an order for delivery and in the middle of this sentence she hung up on me. I work at a restaurant that takes customer reviews and satisfaction extremely seriously, and I am really frustrated at the treatment that I just received. I understand it's Saturday night and it's busy, but representatives of restaurants need to be capable of dealing professionally with all customers, including those who have food allergies that are out of their control. I was going to place an order at the restaurant, but the last thing I want to do now is call these people back and jump through hoops to make sure the food I buy won't make me sick."
2,-1,"After reading the reviews, we decided to give it a try. ??Average at best. ??Not worth an hour wait or the high price for a stack of very average pancakes. ??Not quite sure where the rave reviews are coming from."
5,-1,"Try the Bouchee A La Reine...just heaven. ??You might as well go for something that you're not going to find many other places, and this was delicious. ??This is probably one of the only times I've decided that I have to go back the next time I'm in town and relive that dining experience. ??Great live music on Saturday night, and a very relaxed atmosphere, which only made it easier to enjoy this amazing meal."
4,-1,"Normally, I'm not allowed to eat my lunch at Pommes Frites. ??This is a personal restriction, based on thigh to denim ratios, but I was really pissy ??this one day, so I had the Poutine - AKA disco fries. ??Well, let me tell you, they rock! ?? Fried potatoes, chicken gravy,& ??cheese. What? ??Did somone say extra salt? ??What a perfect guilty treat. ??Get ??the extra hot sauce & chalk it up to penance...."
5,1,"What I said when attempting to slowly devour the fantastic homemade peach pie for dessert: ""Oh my! this is one of the best pie crusts--so flakey and buttery--and the peaches, so fresh and not overly sweetened (or overly cooked/mushy) with sugar! Oh, and the turbino laced, lattice work! So pretty and delicious...almost as good as my grandma's!"" What Cara, my lovely dining companion, probably heard: ""ohmnomnom...nom, nom, nom......."" What can I say? I never, ever get dessert after a meal, because nothing ever impresses me that much. And let's face it, dessert at most restaurants feels like an afterthought. Well, not here at Northern Spy. Get the Peach Pie with brown sugar ice cream. Just trust me on this. Let me back up. I'd been here a couple times and both meals were beyond satisfying. Locally sourced fruits, veggies and sustainable meats/fish. An ever changing menu, really extensive wine list, daily specials, and a happy hour 4-7*, what's not to like? -Heirloom Tomato Salad (with and w/out feta) Absolutely perfect. To me, this is summer in a bowl. Lightly seasoned with a bit of basil and a vinaigrette. -Farmer's Market Salad with baby turnips, baby leeks, carrots and a light yogurt dressing, was very crisp and flavorful. -Gnocchi with cherry tomato sauce, favas, baby peas and basil. Holy moly! This was the *lightest* gnocchi I've ever eaten. (You know how a lot of people don't know how to make gnocchi? Usually it's very heavy/doughy and semolina-y....but not here.) The gnocchi was lightly sauteed potato pillows, gently placed on top of a freshly made cherry tomato sauce, sprinkled with favas and peas. Delightful! I spied other tables that had ordered the Kale Salad with pecorino, summer squash and toasted almonds and I was tempted to ask, ""So, ah...how is that?? And, can I have a bite?"" But I digress. Northern Spy has become one of my new favorite restaurants in the city...and not just because I like the apple of the same name. It's a nice spot to meet up after work for a few glasses of wine and a dish of olives, or, to take a date, or make your parents buy you dinner. So, go here....and let me know if you go, because I want some more peach pie. *They do a really nice, generous pour on the wine too."
2,-1,I don't know if it is really worth the wait. ??And it is crazy how expensive it is. ??I had the yokohama and it was a little too much flavor. ??My friend had one of the lighter ones and it was much better. ??I am not a big fan of loud yelling either.
2,-1,"Researched the best Pad Thai in NYC and we made a special trip. ??So excited to try it (we did take out on the way to the airport) and can't tell you how disappointed we were. ??Dry noodles, very little flavor--I make better Pad Thai at home. ??Oh well."
4,1,"Great deal for lunch! Beatiful decor & excellent service. The menu is easy to understand with detailed description of sauces. I was confident ordering & very happy with my selection, shrimp in basil sauce jasmine rice, and rolls. I cant wait to go back & try other dishes."
3,-1,"The food and service were good, nothing great but a solid good. Quite a bit of hype for just good though."
1,-1,"The food is mediocre for the price...the service is horrendous...The owner Paul ??has lost many customers due to his rude, arrogant way of speaking to people..I know of at least 10 of us who will not go back, not so much because of the food but for being treated like an idiot ...the floor needs to be cleaned once in a while too! ??I would hazard a guess they will not be in business for long if they don't listen to their customers."
1,-1,"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!! The manager yelled at me as we were leaving! First he pestered us multiple times to leave because he wanted to seat other people at our table (I'm sorry, is this a French restaurant?), mind you, it's late on Thursday night, there are 7 other tables open (yes, I counted them). We said, ""That's fine, can we have the check."" He then came back numerous times because he didn't think we were paying fast enough! Then as we were leaving he pulled me and a friend aside and demanded to know what I had said to my waitress! He said, ""If you have something to say, say it to me, I'm the manager!"" I answered him, ""I told her the tip was strictly for her, because you were rude"" He then proceeds to scream at me in front of all his other customers, calling ME rude and finally culminates in him yelling, ""Good riddance!!!"" at me as I am trying to get the door open and get away from this giant buffoon. Needless to say, horrible experience and I would never recommend it. The pity too is that I was with a MoMA curator and we had been thinking about planning an after party at this restaurant. Thankfully we were saved from any future embarrassment! I can only imagine this giant asshole screaming at my poor mother, ""Drink your coffee faster!!"""
3,1,"The broth was very good, thick & rich But I do not like the noodle It is not the traditional ramen noodle that I had in Tokyo. The ramen noodle should be bit of yellow and bit transparent. Also it doesn't have any flour or doughy taste. The ramen noodle should be nutty, bit chewy, bouncy, it is very unique noodle that you can only find in Japanese traditional ramen I am not sure why totto ramen chose this doughy noodle Also the ramen seriously lacks in topping Unless you pay extra to add additional topping, it only comes with two very thin slice of pork fat and scallion."
3,1,"Had a great time at Alameda the other night. First off: the decor! When you walk in it certainly has that wow factor with the giant U shaped bar. I felt like I just entered the 1950s with the finishes and decor. We were seated immediately with our group of 4 in a quaint little nook. I did notice the restaurant was super hot- maybe because of the large crowd but during summer it was pretty uncomfortable. The menu is on the smaller size which I am learning to appreciate given it normally includes seasonal items and each item has a little more attention drawn to it. I had the fresh tomato ricotta crostini which was delicious. It had some kind of basil sauce added to it which made it super fresh and flavorful. The burger was also really yummy as was the octopus entree. Drinks were on the pricier side but also a good selection. I like how chill the atmosphere is and also impressive at the same time. We weren't overly hungry so Alameda served a good selection if you wanted to chow down or have a small bite and get out of the house. It was definitely pricier than other restaurants in the area but has the show stopping atmosphere which makes it worth the experience. Stars were knocked off because of prices, the general heating system, and that our waitress sort of rushed us out (not intentionally, but she was a bit too eager to hand us the check). Regardless, I will be back!"
2,-1,"Host was super nice, but that was really the only positive point of the dining experience. Guacamole was ok. Drinks are expensive. Ordered tacos there was nothing but steak and cilantro in them and the steak was over cooked. Over all wouldn't go back, can defiantly get better Mexican food in the area."
3,1,"I've been to the Smith on numerous occasions and the quality has remained consistently average. My friends seem to enjoy it, which is why we go, and it has a great atmosphere if you just want to grab a few drinks, but there are almost an endless supply of restaurants that prepare a better steak in midtown. If you make a reservation, which I suggest, expect to wait an additional 30 minutes if you have others plans to go out afterwards, as service is slow and you are rarely seated on time. Our table for four, was more fit for a table of two, it was extremely crowded. I ordered my steak rare, and it was labeled rare, but was more of a medium well. The Calamari also did not meet expectations. The prices are relatively inexpensive, but prepare to be underwhelmed with everything but the aesthetics."
4,1,"I am an avid tea drinker, so when I go to Cha-An, I go to drink Japanese green tea, which is excellent here. Their lunch menu is also very affordable and tasty. Reminds me of home food in Japan and a fancy tea house all in the same place."
4,-1,"We have been there twice in three weeks; the first night it was a Tuesday early so there was hardly anyone there. ??But we were impressed with the quality of the food and the friendly staff. ??We returned two weeks later on the evening with the Flamenco dancing, got a seat right next to the dance floor. ??It was a great evening--the food was good, the mango sangria was very good. ??An uneven table caused a quite accidental drink spill and the waiter responded graciously with towels...and a free pitcher of sangria! ??We stayed for three hours, had four or five tapas, watched a first rate floor show...and got out for less than $100 for two. ??We will definitely be back many times."
4,1,"On a recent trip to NYC I had the pleasure of eating at Benito One. ??I was in town w/ friends for CMJ and after a few shows and a few cocktails we decided food was in order - so, off to Little Italy we went. We peered into a few places and decided to give Benito's a shot. ??The aroma of the food hit us as we walked inside & I smiled. ??It wasn't very busy and we were sat, got bread and had drinks on the table promptly. There were many items on the menu that sounded delicious but I was in the mood for gnocchi. ??They happily added pancetta to my dish and the end result was fantastic. ??I sampled my friend's pescatore and thought that was excellent too. ??The chicken dishes were flavorful but the chicken was a lil' dry. ??Everything was nicely portioned & priced very reasonably. I really enjoyed Benito One. ??It didn't seem trendy or overly fancy. ??They just serve damn good food."
4,-1,"Great place for lunch. Their burger is fantastic. Probably one of the best burgers in town-if anyone cares anymore. Overall, this restaurant has excellent service with nice meal presentation, and opts to leave out the fussiness. I highly recommend eating here. Cheers."
2,1,"I can't really speak for the food here, but the one thing that stuck out was the extremely slow service. I came here as part of a big group with a reservation. Since I had eaten beforehand, I only ordered a bowl of garlic fries to nibble on. They were an expensive $8 bowl of fries that wasn't garlic-y. Other had ordered a mix of appetizers and mains. The appetizers came out maybe 20 mins after we ordered, but the mains came out at least an hour after they were ordered. They had a relatively small menu, so you'd think they'd be able to deliver the limited types of food quicker. I wouldn't come back."
4,1,"Visited this restaurant this past weekend as a treat for parents anniversary dinner. ??We were a group of 5 and made an 8:15 reservation and were running late. ??The Ilili staff was very cooperative and friendly in pushing our reservation to 8:45 when I called about the situation. ??When we arrived, we were promptly seated and greeted by one of their friendly and smiling servers. ??She was very helpful in explaining some of the menu items. ?? To start us off, we ordered the following small plates: ??brussel sprouts, phoenician fries, black iron shrimp, tabbouleh, lahmajeen and manti. ??Everything was delicious, and had its own unique taste. ??I even forgot I was having brussel sprouts - the sweet taste to the dish was amazing. ??The manti were tiny bite size pasta filled with lamb with a yogurt base - expected from a Middle Eastern dish. ??The Lahmajeen can be best described as a quesadilla looking dish with ground lamb on top, cut into 4 triangular pieces. From the main plates, we ordered the Mixed Grill, Lamb Chops and Chicken Taouk Duo with a side order of Riz. ??The food is also accompanied by pita bread. ??Parents loved the tenderness of the lamb and were very happy with the meal, although some of the lamb chops had excess fat and made it harder to chew. ??All of the items including the small plates were shared among 5 people and was more than enough to leave us satisfied and have room for dessert. ?? Finally for dessert, we ordered the warm date cake, pistachio financier and the mixed baklava. ??The staff was very courteous in adding a candle to to the warm date cake to celebrate the special occasion. ??Dessert was absolutely heavenly and were beyond satisfying to our sweet teeth :) ?? The warm date cake can closely resemble the triple chocolate meltdown from Applebee's, only richer in taste with the distinct taste of dates. ??The Pistachio Financier and Baklava were not too sweet or drenched in honey which was perfect for us. We didn't visit this place during Restaurant Week, but it definitely was an evening well spent in trying a new restaurant in the city and had a chance to explore the other menu items. ??Our server was very friendly and ended the night by taking a family pic before we left. ??I would definitely come back for the starters and dessert."

5,1,"I've been coming here for years! Especially when I used to work just a block away from K-town. Something about this place makes it feel so cozy, and not stuffy. Pros: - Great selection of foods (Hot, Cold) - Beverages, another great selection. They even serve alcohol (YES!) - Lots of seating around - Prices are reasonable, (ex: You get this nice bowl of Kimchi rice w/ egg for 5 bucks) Cons: None that I can address"
4,-1,"My boyfriend and I had the pleasure of dining here recently. We had read the rave reviews and our companies have done long time business with this restaurant so we were quite familiar with the quality of food they were purchasing. I have to say we were pleasantly surprised that Uva was as amazing a place as we were told. We had the honey and ricotta bruschette to start and it was divine, so creamy with just the right amount of sweetness. We also had the shrimp pasta and the truffle pizza ( I can't recall the exact names but they were oh so good) Unfortunately we were to full for dessert but we have definitely marked Uva as a fan favorite, Chef Claudio is definitely doing an excellent job on creating exquisite Italian cuisine."
5,1,"Absolutely thrilled to find this place. Thank you fellow yelpers, your reviews made this happen. My new favorite sandwich place despite only having one small sandwich. I got the #10 which is just turkey with salami and provolone. I wouldn't have thought to combine them but I'm glad they thought of it for me. I only ordered a half sandwich which was perfect for me and prevented an afternoon food coma. Loved the homemade iced tea and I hope it comes in a larger size. Huge bonus for me was that they had Crunchie bars and Cheese and Onion Tayto crisps. Walls are lined with all kinds of different imported goods and of course the cheese selection behind the counter looks impressive. I see my self going here very frequently."
1,-1,"This place had shockingly poor service and aggressive staff. ??As someone who has worked in restaurants, I was appalled at the rude and obnoxious attitude of the staff. ??For an expensive meal, which was fine, not great, I was completely turned off by the atmosphere and treatment. There are too many pleasant and enjoyable places to eat in Brooklyn to eat here. ??Don't be fooled by nice reviews, go somewhere else."
5,1,"the regular dinner i had here off the menu was good, not great. ??very interesting drinks, tasty bites but not mind blowing. ?? i came back for the pork butt dinner. ??holy crap!

4,-1,"Always looking for decent places to eat in the West Village/Union Square area, a friend introduced me to this Cuban diner. Though it is open 24/7, the food did not disappoint at all! I came here on a Saturday in the late afternoon with a couple of friends, among them a Mexican and a Puerto Rican who gave a thumbs up to their sweet plaintains! If you're looking for a heartier dish, try the ropa vieja.... delicious slow cooked beef! I ordered the ceviche limeno, which was a bit too tangy for me. If you're not feeling the Latin vibe, there are decent basic breakfast choices served all day. Friendly and attentive staff, very affordable, sanitary, nice decor, no wait time for us, and best of all, open all day & night!"
5,-1,"Amazing food, and fast service once you actually get seated. You may have to wait a while and they do not take reservations but the popularity is justified. I just wish this place wasn't spitting distance from Times Square. However if you have to be in Midtown then a visit to Sake Bar Hagi will make it more than worthwhile."
5,1,"This place begins with 5 stars because it's a ""secret"" restaurant. You can not get the number and a reservation without knowing someone that has been. LOVE. Now for the food...we got the tasting menu. It is ENOUGH food. I was stuffed. You begin with veggies in a dipping sauce, which is ok. It's healthy and might serve as a palate cleanser. Next is this croquette with sea urchin...delicious. The shirt rub sashimi is yummy...add the wasabi, garlic, and dip in soy sauce. The branzino is sooooo fresh. It comes with potatoes, brussel sprouts, mushroom, cauliflower, zuchinni, garlic, anchovy, and olives. I enjoyed the potatoes, Brussel sprouts, and cauliflower. If you can get in, this is a must go!!!"
5,-1,The perfect peaceful hideaway from the chaos of the city. Jazz of Coltrane's softer side and Ella Fitzgerald murmurs in the background as you enjoy the serene atmosphere of the Japanese teahouse. A menu of various teas awaits your discovery. I've been there a couple of times and enjoyed every visit. The chocolate cake with raspberry sauce is heavenly. I recommend doing the sauce as a shot. Also the sweet potato samosas are delicious too. I'm thrilled to have found such a gem of a place.
4,-1,"Delicious ramen!!!! Love that they can put avocado in it! Avocado! yummmmmmmmmm.... Went there once for boyf's birthday & got extra special treatment by the waiter. Score! ??Waiters are mad busy but always super nice. Feel bad for the fella who manages the massive waitlist but he is always fair and on the ball. The vegetarian ramen was a bit weird - a whole garden full of veg (not a bad thing, necessarily) crammed into the bowl. Seemed like a giant salad with broth poured over it. The only sucky thing about this place is the LINE OUTSIDE!!!! Gross! The staff does a great job of keeping track of it, and it's a testament to how good this place is, but it is still awkward and cramped and makes me angry to be that close to other humans when I am starving for delicious ramen. I have never NOT seen a gigantic line outside this place, no matter what day or time (I used to work around the corner). Terrible wait line not the reason why I gave 4 stars. My hearty belongs to Minca, which gets 5. But Totto is awesome if you happen to be in that shitville known as Midtown."
4,1,"While staying in New York, I took two trains just to get to Penelope. My motivation... Nutella French toast. The first three bites were TOE-CURLING AMAZING. After that it was just too sweet. I recommend you ask for the caramelized bananas on the side. Penelope, come to Miami!"
4,1,"Very tasty shrimp served in an unassuming fun environment. The lobster/crab options seemed overpriced, but the value of the shrimp was good. ??The beer was suitably cold to help tame the spicy sauce. 4 stars due to cash only and super long waits that do not always result in a call back."
4,1,Great food. Amazing service. Been here a coiple times and feel like you cant go wrong!
5,1,"I struggle to think of a better culinary experience lately that tops Feast. ??From the intimate, homey ambiance and the personable staff to the incredible spread of food that surprises and delights, this place hits all the high notes. I went on a Tuesday night with friends for dinner when it wasn't too crowded, and we all got the vegetarian farmer's market tasting menu. I think we had around 9 different plates, and every. single. one. was soooo delicious. As in, even a devout carnivore would have loved it. ??This place is every reason people gush about the food in NY!"
5,-1,"This place definitely lived up to the hype. ??As soon as I entered the servers were extremely friendly and even offered to take my coffee I was drinking and put it in a cup as I sat down. ??The menu was clear and concise and the selection of food was vast and every dish sounded as delicious as the next. ?? I had the tartare, lamb loin and cookies for dessert. ??My favourite of the dishes was definitely the lamb as it was so soft and non gamey tasting at all. ??It was very tender and the sauces it came with on the plate complimented the meat nicely. ??The cookies were a nice treat, with a small flask of milk included to wash things down. ??I was not the biggest fan of the tartare as the meat was a little tough and hard to chew through. ??The server did however explain to me the type of cut that was used and why the meat had that kind of texture. Overall I had a great dining experience here and the service was some of the best I have ever had. ??There was always bread in my basket and water in my cup and after each dish came out the waiters would constantly ask how the food was. ??I would love to come back here again and try various other items on the menu in the future!"
4,1,"Brickyard Gastropub is your typical friendly neighborhood gastropub, fully equipped with food, an excellent beer selection, and hilarious Irish bartender. Very casual, open late, this is a great, non-touristy place to grab a bite in the theater district or just some casual drinks. I highly recommend the ginger beer and the artichoke dip, which is served with soft, home-made pita chips that are delicious. It's clotted arteries on a plate but totally worth it. Also noteworthy are the truffle fries. I only took off one star because I don't like the veggie burger here at all, but generally the food is great."
4,1,"This place is adorable (nice decor and lighting), although a little on the loud side, and they do that NYC thing where they cram the tables really close together. The food was excellent and decently priced. We got a yummy crispy calamari appetizer, the catfish clay pot (delicate and sweet and with crispy bok choy), and a flat noodle with duck (also delicious and flavourful). The service was good too. The only weird thing was I think it was restaurant week, and they had a special $38 3-course menu which would have cost exactly the same as ordering off the regular menu (and with more limited options to boot). Tourist trap? We didn't get dessert, ordered two entrees, and shared an app, and that all was $38, and more than enough food."
4,1,"This place rocks!!! Lovely selection of homemade items, charming decor and absolutely one of the friendlist staffs anywhere in AMERICA. Recommend Lime Rickey's - make you feel like a kid EGG Creams - What I imagines this drink to taste like Turkey Melt - Great Sandwich - made me sleepy afterwards Breakfast - almost anything - love the beef sausages (albeit I do not eat pork so this might be a bit biased of an opinion)"
3,1,"Ate brunch. had tripe. The tripe was good, but I felt it should have came with bread instead of the cracker-like flatbread. it was in a slightly spicy tomato sauce. needed the bread to go with the sauce. H.Ngo got a porchetta egg dish. Deceived in that it didn't state it was a sandwich. And, the porchetta were thin slices of porchetta. I was thinking more like chunks of fresh hot porchetta with eggs on top. Nothing like that. The menu revolves around the pig. There were some pastries that looked good."
4,1,"You're cool, Coppelia. Real cool. This was a nightcap on a Lori L.-led food crawl of the West Village. I was already stuffed from Joe's Pizza, Big Gay ice cream, and Taim's falafel balls (in that order), but I did dip into the SO's chicharron-spattered Mac and Cheese, which also kept Allison C. and Hilary P. busy. Delicious! Lori seemed very happy with her Cubano sandwich, one of my Cuban go-to's when I'm not cloyed. The menu is kind of of Pan Latin, with Peruvian and Central American stuff on offer as well. My mojito was excellent (always the measure of a good Cuban eatery). Good-looking place, good-looking people, and a casually hopping atmosphere. Everything you need for a good time with friends any time of night (they're open 24 hours). A pretty sweet alternative to Coffee Shop for you night owls. I want to go back!"
5,1,"I've been here quite a few times now. Everything on the menu is fabulous. I especially enjoy the burger, fries and kale fried rice. I recommend making a reservation because they are strict with seating arrangements."
5,1,The best sushi I've ever had (note: I have not been to Japan). ??Worth going to.
3,1,"Okay I've been a fan of this place for a long time but am I the only one getting burnt pizza lately? I would be giving a full 5 stars if it tasted the way it used to but the past three or four times I've gone, the bottom of my slice is completely black and inedible. The artichoke topping is still delicious and the slice is still enormous but lately, I always leave a good portion uneaten because it's all burnt. It's sad. Despite it all, I still go, hoping I'll get that perfectly cooked piece. It IS ridiculously delicious otherwise."
3,1,"Good place to go for a casual dinner or pre-concert drinks (Webster Hall is conveniently across the street). Food is good, not outstanding. Everything is a bit over-priced here in my opinion. Even though their portions are generous, I could barely taste the gin in my $10 cocktails."
5,-1,It's rare that you find a gem like this amongst so many mediocre places in Chinatown. ??The food is excellent. ??Best wontons and dumplings I've had in the City by far. ??Will definitely go again.
4,-1,"This place is amazing! The happy hour lasts until 10 everyday and includes the lychee martini....yum! The food is delicious...sticky coconut rice, veggie pancakes. Everyone talks about the lychee martini but there are other great drinks available for happy hour. I really like their sangria. It has a cool atmosphere due to great music, artwork on the walls and a pretty diverse and young crowd. The music is too loud! You will have to yell to have a conversation. ??Another slightly annoying aspect is that the placed gets over crowded. But for a $5 lychee martinis...it's worth it! ??Definitely a good after work place for friends to share tapas and get drunk cheaply:)"
3,1,Good Tapas.
4,1,Excellent frittata for me and waffles for the kid. Service was quick and pleasant and the decor is lovely. Only $6 for breakfast specials!! We will come back for sure.
3,1,"Don't get it. ??Shane's is so much better and serves the same kind of food. Okay, the atmosphere is kitschy fun, and I like the egg cream sodas. The food is just all right though. ?? There is nothing wrong with this place--although i did see a cockroach on the bar/counter once many, many years ago. Why anyone would want to eat the icky industrial cookies they give away sometimes is beyond me but its sweet that they offer them. Burgers are better at Shanes, at Zaytoons, were better at Homage even. Eggs better next door at Shanes too. What's to like then? ??Its a great place to take guests who want to have a traditional diner experience a sort of Americana moment. ??The service is beyond attentive, and you get the warm fuzzy feeling of eating in a place that has been there forever."
4,1,Loved the chicken & waffles here. The waffles with banana foster sauce was especially tasty! The buttermilk fried chicken here is unique and goes well with some hot sauce and ranch sauce (available upon request). I'm very much glad with my choice and I wouldn't hesitate to come back and try other things on their menu. bon apet??t.
4,-1,"Honored the reservation. Always a plus before a show. Host staff needs work though. The dude was having a heated argument with a customer right at the front door. Cramped quarters, but that's to be expected in the theater district. What wasn't expected, however, was how gruffly they push they table in toward you once you're seated. No big. The food rocked it. Had the lobster roll with those skinny fries. So good we came back the next night. Chocolate pudding cake was off the charts and I'm not a dessert guy. It also wasn't my dessert. My girlfriend was pissed because I chowed most of hers."
5,-1,"Good god I love this place. Jenga? Free cheese puffs? Frito pie? Hot dogs? Beam Creams? Sold. And people can buy you drinks while you aren't around, and then you come in and see your name up on a board and soon enough you have a free drink in your hand! It's magical. There's also a jukebox, pool (which is fun even though I am horrible), darts, scrabble AND connect four! Plus, I just found out I can bring my dog. This place could not get better if it tried."
5,-1,This is one of my favorite places to go to. The oysters are the best tasting oysters in the planet. Their seafood is always fresh and top quality. Nice and cozy place although i wish the restaurant was a bit bigger. ?? The restaurant gets crowded and the wait for a table is usually pretty long because they don't take reservations unless your with a party of 5 or greater but its totally worth the wait. Great service and amazing seafood.
5,1,Excellent sandwiches and good prices. Hole in the wall. Staff was friendly and I'd definitely come back.
2,1,"Overrated! Good but doesn't deserve 4.5 stars. Food is too simple, atmosphere is nice yet too crowded."
5,-1,"Beautifully cooked and presented dishes with attentive service. Eggs Benedict was yummy and the unusual herb based Brunch cocktail just the ticket for a lazy Sunday holiday morning. Not the cheapest, but justified by combining cost of breakfast and dinner!"
5,-1,"I don't usually (or ever) write reviews on Yelp but my experience at Jeepney definitely merits one. Note that they are still in their soft-opening phase so the menu offered is not the full menu. We came on Saturday night at around 7:00pm. It was a 20 minute wait for the table, not too bad considering it was an hour or so wait by the time we left. The ambience and decor is perfect, what you would expect from a Filipino Gastropub. Lots of kitschy ??Pinoy pop culture items. Though I do hope they plan to change the sign in front as the single ""J"" isn't too inviting. I ordered a Cubao X (Lager, tang orange juice, black walnut bitters) which was on the sweet side, but loved it nonetheless.I had the Ayala Ave (white wine, elder flower cordiel, lime, ampalaya) too later in the night but I preferred the Cubao X. For our main dishes (which are meant to be shared), the Pancit Malabok came first. A twist of the Pancit Palabok and Malabon, it is a noodle dish filled with squid ink and shrimp paste, topped with chicharon, calamari, oysters and shrimp. I am not a fan of Palabok personally, but this one was probably my favorite dish of the night, and made me reconsider by apathy for the dish. Really tasty. The Spicy Filipino Bangers and Mash (5-meat embutido) was delicious as well. I was with a big meatloaf fan and he said this was probably the best meatloaf he's ever had. And the mashed sweet potato was very good. Next came the defeated chicken, pretty much adobo, mindanao-style. This dish was okay, still good, but not as exotic or surprising as the others. Last but definiely not least, the Chori Burger (chorizo and beef patty with several condiments). The burger itself was so delicious we did not even bother putting condiments on. Overall, a great experience and I look forward to coming back. If this is only the soft-opening, we can expect even greater things from Jeepney in the future!"
4,1,"Probably one of my favorite places to go in Chinatown. Food comes out mad quick, everything is ridiculously cheap, and you get a glass of free tea! I really enjoy the roast pork noodles and the congee with fried dough sticks. I never spend more than $6 here including tip, which is pretty darn impressive. Plus, they're the only place that's still open in the middle of the night. Mad kudos to you Noodle Town considering the fact that the rest of Chinatown shuts down around 6-8 PM."
5,1,"Awesome. ??This is the first Serbian I've found since St. Petersburg. ??Super good! ??just go here. ??This is what new york is famous for in the foodie travel book- lesser known cuisines that rival the authenticity of dishes prepared in terra materna. Some things we had of which other westerners looked jealous- mixed grill plate for 2, cheese tomato and cucumber salad, cheese phyllo pastry appetizer, slovovitz"
5,1,"Being recently diagnosed with a gluten intolerance; I'm on a quest to finding great gluten free restaurants for me, as well as the company who I'm with, who aren't gluten free. Bistango is perfect! I had two cousins who came from out of town and they wanted great italian food. They were so glad I took them here. When we first arrived, the restaurant is not small and not too big, but the perfect fit. The waitress was very friendly and immediately asked if we had food allergies. I got the gluten free eggplant ravioli which was excellent; followed by the gluten free velvet cake which was AMAZING! The others too enjoyed their food. Only downside is the lack of vegetairan appetizers, but they have tons of vegetaraian entrees and dessert options. I will definitely be coming here again. Restaurant is great for groups (8 or less), not too kid friendly."
3,1,Went here for a girls night out and had a good time the food was delicious and the Sangria was some of the best I ever tasted but here is where I start the complaining our waitress was HORRIBLE her attitude sucked and she did none of the work the guy who kept coming to pour our water did more work then she did and this is what tops the cake she had the nerve to stop us on the way out to say we didn't give her enough tip money she had some nerve she should be happy we gave her a tip in the first place because she did absolutely nothing but came to our table once to see if we were okay I would have gave this place 5 stars because I really like place and the service was outstanding except for our waitress I'm glad we were able to talk to manager about the situation
4,-1,"I really like this place! After walking up and down St Marks Place looking for somewhere to get cheap, good food, my friends and I decided to give this a shot and I'm so glad we did! The sliders were delicious and pretty filling. As for the location it self, very cool decor, nice, laid back vibe, awesome art on the wall. Staff was super-friendly too. It was a little cramped, but really, what can you expect in the city? ??Overall a great find for anyone looking for cheap, delicious food. Will visit again next time I'm in the area!"
5,1,"Difficult to pick a favorite because all the dishes we tried were wonderful, but I'd have to say the pork belly was incredibly good. Cute little restaurant!"
5,-1,"This place is AMAZING! I didn't know I was a latin food fan until I ate there this past wknd. We went on a Sat night with no reservations and enjoyed a delicious spicy pepper cocktail at the bar while we waited for our table. The hostess worked fast to seat us within 20 min and the servers were very fast, efficient, and attentive. We got the ceviche, arapas, guacamole, and fish tacos. The Fish tacos have to be in the top 10 best things I've ever eaten. The guac was also the best guac I've ever had. The manager came over to make sure we enjoyed everything, shook my bf's hand, and even helped me put my coat on before we left. I will def add this restaurant to my group of regulars in NYC. Plus somehow our bill was only $105 after all those appetizers and drinks. Loved it!"
3,1,"The sangria and the ceviches were very good (nothing spectacular, though). The flank steak was a complete let-down on the other hand. Bland, very chewy and over-priced for all the hype in the reviews. The avocado salad (basically a guac) tasted tart (waited too much?). The decor was nice and the service was attentive. I would not go back for dinner. Maybe for a glass of sangria and some ceviche."
4,1,"i love olea and have been going to their brunch pretty regularly since living in the clinton hill/fort greene area. i can't speak for any of their dinner items nor many of their brunch items, but i can say that the parmesan toast is amazing. and i usually have entree envy when i see what people next to me are eating, though i've not been adventurous enough to veer from the parmesan toast. the service is standard, nothing extraordinarily hospitable or prompt, but i go during peak hour at brunch so am not expecting a welcoming committee. they're efficient and take time to refill coffee, which is good enough for me. the interior is homey and mediterranean with a smattering of huge plants that threaten to devour children left unattended. expect a considerable wait during peak hours, but be sure to while it away with their awesome bloody marys."
4,1,YUM... and fun. This little Cuban joint is a favorite East Village spot among my friends. ??The sangria is sooooo good and the food is so flavorful albeit rich.
5,-1,"We have been here many, many times, and it only gets better. Amazing service, live music, great drinks, good wine available, and most of all: the food is outstanding! And they are consistent, and never disappoint."
3,1,"I've been in the neighborhood long enough to have been to Roberta's during their opening days, excited to finally have something other than Northeast Kingdom (which at the time was mediocre, but has since become a top choice). ??I loved the restaurant then, but I don't love it now. ??Now, it is just okay. The reason I go for 3 stars rather than 4 is because Roberta's is incredibly overhyped. ??The recent NY Times review was just too much, and the up to 2 hour waits on weekends and evenings are uncalled for. ??In addition the staff is not very friendly, especially when it comes time to telling you to wait. ?? They have expanded their seating, basically doubled it if you count outdoor seating, and yet they still only have one bathroom for men and one for women. ??Finally, the bridge and tunnel crowd (from Manhattan) ruins this place. ??Forget about running out of your loft next door and striding into your local pizza joint, forget about a nice walk from residential Bushwick that ends with a nice pizza and a glass of wine, forget about calling a friend and saying ""hey, meet me at Roberta's for a pizza, So-and-so's there now."" ??You'll be contending with an older, richer crowd arriving in Mercedes SUV's, slumming it in Bushwick. ??They'll be enjoying their 4th course by the time you get seated, and you'll be jealous that you can't afford to have what they are having ;) If you must eat at Roberta's, here are some tips: 1) Go during off hours. ??Arrive for dinner at 6 or so, or just pop in for lunch. ?? 2) Get pizza. ??The pizza is solid. ??Its not the best in NY (I'm not telling where the best is, because its crowded enough as it is!) ??Motorino is just as good, as is Saraghina in Best Stuy. ??Other stuff on the menu is overpriced and generally OK (of course, I haven't had the tasting menu the NY Times raves about). 3) Don't expect much. ??Just go, have a few drinks, have a nice time and don't expect great service. ??Remain calm when you have to wait for the bathroom, and don't get upset if you are left alone for long periods at a time or have a waiter that doesn't know anything about wine. ??You are just grabbing a pizza, and ordering a beer or the cheapest ""pizza wine"". ?? Enjoy! *I have to hand it to the owners... they have managed to take a scrappy bohemian joint and somehow gear it to a fine dining crowd from manhattan. ??Their business plan is brilliant. ??Pizza is incredibly cheap to make, and they have cut out the cheap ""working man's slice"" which they used to serve as a cheap lunch option. ??People flood in from other parts of the city and they are always busy. ??On top of that, they have managed to grow many of their own ingredients and they do well on the whole back to basics food thing."

5,1,"Having been to Sleep No More before, I knew a little bit what The Heath would be like. My expectations were high and they were met or exceeded at every turn! We arrived at 8PM and the restaurant was almost empty (the early Saturday show had just begun). The detail with which the decorations, ambience (fog machine!), acting, and overarching storyline were executed was to the highest standard! Since we were one of the few full tables at the time, we had a chance to interact with several of the actors before our dinner began. I didn't realize there were be so many Sleep No More elements to the dinner. At one point, my boyfriend was called away from our table by a host because he had a ""phone call"" and he was whisked away for 15 or so minutes. Upon his return, he had lots of details to share about the Heath/Gallow Green folklore. :) A live jazz band played during the majority of our dinner and they rounded out the perfection of the evening. Oh, and the food was delicious also."

4,1,"This is one of my favorite NYC gems! I want to keep it all to myself. If you don't know about this place.. get ready for a pleasent surprise. You would completely miss this place's entrance if you didn't go with an insider. You walk down an alley and at the end is the doorway to your brunch wonderland! And the white rabbit is most likely stuffed and on display. You feel transported to a foreign chic countryside 2 story home. When you walk in the hostess spot is on the left and you can get your name on the list, there is always a list. Lucky for us there is also two bars with super tasty, crafty cocktails. And you if you want you can also eat at the ??bar instead of wait for the list. The menu is simple and straight forward for brunch. I always enjoy the skillet eggs without meat served with the creamy grits and melty cheddar with a side of buttered toast. ??The egg white omelet, I like with regular eggs. It comes in a cast iron skillet and I love the starchy goodness of the butternut squash melting with the ricotta. I am always a fan of a nice side of greens with my brunch too."
4,1,"I have dreams about of Freeman's appetizer, devils on horse back (roasted dates wrapped in bacon) and their toffee cake, spiced with the perfect amount of sugar glaze. To Die For. Their cockatils are also terrific and every time I've had a full meal, I've always gone away happy. Draw back - it gets very crowded, but its worth it."
4,-1,This place is really good. I like the way the restaurant is setup. makes me feel like im not in the city. ??you ahve to go early though or else theres a long wait. the food is simple but really good. good place to take a date or a friend.
5,-1,"Walking by in Soho on Saturday night we stopped by this small bistro, it was a nice evening and their French doors were open. We ??asked for a table and it was a long wait so we decided to eat at the bar. The bartender was very busy ??but she was very nice and accommodating . We had a crab cake, escargot ??and for dinner we had the 1/2 duck special and the monk fish. Food was delicious and ??surpassed our expectation . Definitely will be back with reservation."
4,-1,"This place is great. Super cool, hipster atmosphere- and great hearty, filling food!! Ive been here a couple times with friends at night and also done the weekend brunch. Expect a wait to be seated, but once you are-- no complaints. Wish the drink prices were cheaper (around $10 a cocktail) i guess thats the upper west side for ya! How about a seasonal menu Jacob?? been coming for over a year and its the same ole' stuff! Also, request BO as a server! He's the nicest server there (and not bad looking either ;) )He's been with the place since the beginning, so he knows the food and drinks well."
5,-1,"We had dinner there, linguine vongole and sliders and fire roasted broccoli, ??Food was very good, great service, friendly staff and the place had a great vibe to it. ??Diego was our bartender and terrific to talk to; he is from Brazil. ??We would go back in a heartbeat, ??Good value."
4,1,"Cute, little place in Tribeca just a stone's throw from the subway/PATH station. ??The food is great, as are the chickpea-filled tables, which provided a nice touch. ??You order at the register, grab a drink, and grab a seat. ??I would say the place seats about 20-25 people (there is one communal table and 2 or 3 smaller tables) so I can imagine this would get packed at lunchtime. ??My friends went around 7:30 and we still had to wait for a seat so it's just that kind of place. I ordered the popeye sandwich (spinach, falafel, hummus, salad in a wheat pita) with a can of coke and the total came to around $10. ??It was very filling and they provided a hot sauce (greenish, I wish I knew the name but I am simply not familiar with the terminology) and a cream condiment, which both added a lot to the sandwich. My friends enjoyed their meals as well (one sandwich and one salad) and we all agreed that it was a good choice. However, I must point out that the bathroom was filthy. ??The toilet looked like it hadn't been wiped down in weeks, but I had no choice but to use it because I had a long train ride ahead of me. ??Oh well, if it wasn't for that, I would have given this place 5 stars."

5,-1,"Great drinks from a true pro. Loved his Mescal drinks and had good knowledge of wine. After drinks we went to our table. Wow what a nicely decorated place. Very romantic, great style, unique, cozy. A bit small and cramped but hey, it's NY and it wasn't too cozy. Waiter was all pro, very knowledgeable and helpful. Food was amazing. Chef owner really knows his stuff. If you like true Spanish food, this is your place. If you like great drinks, this is your place. If you expect great service, this is your place."
3,1,Service was good Food was ok. You get a nice private grill and they are good about changing the grill grids between servings. ?? You cook most of the items yourself. so there is nothing too complicated or inventive about the preparations. Once you get over the novelty of cooking your own meal there is nothing all that exciting here.
5,1,This place has the best service I have ever encountered since Marriott!!! And the food is awesome!!
4,1,"Can't comment on the food, but had some drinks here recently. ??Great little spot for a date or catching up with friends. ??Warm, cozy, and a large beer selection. ??Definitely has the low key Brooklyn vibe most are looking for."
4,-1,"What can one say about this place except excellent! Been going there since it opened a few years ago. It keeps expanding and getting better. Olive oil, treats, serrano hams, sweets, sandwiches and allround delicious food presented in a brilliant design. Go there."
3,-1,"There was a lot of hype leading to our brunch here. I have to say that I was blown away by the decor. I like the clean simple look. I'd come here just for the ambiance. The food was good but definitely doesn't blow you away. So therefore, not a fan of coming back for the food. However, if you'd like to arrange something special - not a bad place to come - just don't expect too much from the food!"
4,-1,It was fantastic. The broth has incredible depth with a slight muskiness to it. Delicious! Buns are to die for...
5,1,"I am not a vegetarian so my judgment of Zen's food is solely based on how it compares to its ""real meat"" counterpart. ?? My favorite dish is the mango chicken - amazing! The portions are the perfect size and they give you the option to choose brown rice at no extra cost. The $6 lunch special from 12-4pm which includes a choice of entree/main dish and egg roll or hot & sour soup can't be beat. By the way, the hot & sour soup is amazing! It's summer and I regularly crave the soup. Overall, I think the freshness of the ingredients they use combined with the fusion of flavors they use make for light yet filling and healthy Chinese food. Delivery is quick and the service both for take-out and dine-in is fast, courteous and professional. Love them!"
5,1,"Mark's slider is second to Minetta Tavern's Black Label Burger because I broke a 1 year bet on this burger. I lasted seven months without meat burgers and broke my fast on this baby. I'm not quite sure if that should be sadness or happiness but I'll sway to the latter. Big thanks to Philip N for screening and approving all of my St. Mark's bites this evening. He really knows his food and will not disappoint you. I am happy to have such great friends IRL and it's nice when they cross over into Yelp. The shakes at Mark sound good. Salted Caramel or Strawberry your thing? Yes, mine too. Then again, I rarely decline a shake. Cheap but really decent beer is on the menu. It's St. Mark's! This street will not rip you off! All orders should also include fries. They are perfectly crispy without going hollow in the middle. Best part of Mark other than the sliders? Spicy dipping sauces!! Hello!"
1,-1,"After a very average lunch, I decided to give another chance this place for dinner...The manger (Linda I think...) was so rude that we decided to leave and have dinner somewhere else...great place to waste money and have a bad time..."
5,-1,"The Best Italian Food in New York! ?? I moved to Portland Oregon, but love going back home and this is always one of my stops! ?? The ricotta gnocci is delicious! ??I wish they could ship it to Oregon"
5,-1,Great pizza! My go to place when I want something that hits the spot. They use all fresh ingredients and they are very generous with their pizza topping . Def check them out if you haven't already .. You won't be disappointed
5,1,Favorite Italian in NYC. ??The chef brings out little tastes of dishes as your ordered dishes come out. ??Happy happy taste buds
4,-1,May bot be the healthiest thing but it hits a spot that no man has hit in many moons :) I go for the shawarma and it never fails me. ?? Though I do wish they mixed the ingredients more before throwing it in the pita. ??Nonetheless... the best Shawarma and Falafel in town
5,1,Amazing doesn't begin to describe it....my husband and I have been there a few times and most recently he threw me a birthday party there. As the name suggests you are truly treated to a feast at the restaurant. The menu is inventive and changes with the season. I love going there every few months to see what fabulous concoctions the chef has dreamed up. If you are looking for an amazing culinary experience at a great price look no further!
5,1,"There is something about fried meatless balls covered in tahini and wrapped in a fluffy pita. There is also something about all that goodness and paying only $2.50 for it. Find the hole in the wall that is Mamoun's, place your order, have it brought to you in a mere minutes, pay and go. You can, if you are lucky, acquire seating in the small take out spot but if the weather permits, take your falafel pita to the nearby washington square park and indulge on a park bench. Bring extra napkins. This shit hits the spot every time!"
4,1,"First of all, let me say that though I'm a New Yorker I had never heard of Stone Street. ??And upon going there, I said, ""This street doesn't seem like New York."" ??It's a cobble stone street, no access to cars, and in nice weather they put out tables -- some under tents -- that are shared by the restaurants on the street. ?? Adrienne's Pizza Bar is smack dab in the middle of the block. ??The two of us shared a picnic table with two other girls. ??We ordered the funghi pizza and the cabrese (broccoli rabe and sausage). ??Both were 10 inch pies, that they said were personal pizzas (which is why we ordered one each) but were definitely sizable enough to share. ??The pizza was good, not fantastic, but good. Enjoying tasty pizza and a glass of wine outdoors on a cobblestone street that makes you feel like you've left New York gets Adrienne's the extra star."
5,1,Have been there several times and it never disappoints.
4,1,"The location is very non descript, but the burgers are great! They are served on a paper plate and are cheap but well worth it! Even better with a pint of cider!"
5,1,"Amazing food, amazing people--whiskey with truffles and anything they recommend."
5,-1,"Where to begin, from the moment you enter you are TRANSPORTED!!! The attention is in the details......and everywhere else that is needed for a beautiful experience. The country vibe is very authentic......and the food is fantastic. The bread is well you must take my word for it excellent. We did the Vegetarian feast everything was so amazing I didn't miss the meat. From the appetizers to the dessert was truly an amazing FEAST!"
4,-1,"xcellend chicken curry soup, so spicy i have to water it down."
5,-1,Visiting friends in New York and it was a birthday dinner at Tavern on Jane. I had the Country fried chicken with mashed potatoes it was Amazing!! My husband had the Pork chop also delicious our friends had the Steak and all was brought to us on time and we had a lovely evening. Our waiter was very friendly and he handled our bossy friend carefully lol. I will definitely eat here and recommend to friends. Maria
4,1,Food was good - the chicken was really tender and the green garlic sauce was amazing. Place was packed and you wouldn't be able to get a table without a reservation. Lots of birthdays and atmosphere was very lively.
5,1,"i love love love love love love love this yummy place. ??Like i said in my previous post, i've been living on liver! ??I just get soo excited seeing pate and foie gras on a menu. ??Sitting here, i felt like i was in paris - it was very cute and welcoming. ??Eating here was sooo refreshing. ??They had a really good selection of wines too. ??It was a perfect meal in the middle of a gloomy day."
3,1,"This a teeny, laid back spot in an unexpected location - South Street Seaport. Because it's so small, they only have one bartender working on Saturday nights - or at least, that was the case when I went. The place got really crowded due to the birthday party I was attending and it became hard to fight my way to the bar for a drink. Also there is only one unisex bathroom. ??They have food, but if you order when the place is crowded it will slow down the bartender from making everyone's drinks - not really the best setup. Fresh Salt does win cool points for having somewhat out of the ordinary red wine selections - nebbiolo, cotes du rhone, and sangiovese, rather than the usual merlot, cabernet, and pinot that you often find at bars. If I happened to be rambling around the Seaport again I'd go back."
4,-1,The only Thai restaurant in LIC. ??The quality of the food is okay and the price of the lunch special is great. ??I had the chicken curry and it tasted good. ??Will comeback again soon.
1,-1,"I can deal with having to wait for a table, but having to put up with waiters and waitresses that care more about whether you are SHARING food, rather than giving you good service, is something that I cannot put up with. ??I have eaten here on several occasions, and though the prices have crept up steadily, the service has headed in the opposite direction. ??Its not necessary to tell the customer over and over again that sharing is not allowed. ??Telling them once is enough. ??Staff at this restaurant (ours was a lady named Chen) should spend less time harassing their customers, and worry more about other things - like getting a customers food order correct, and cooking a customers food properly."
1,1,"I'm sorry, but no.... ??Rather than question all of the good reviews of this place, maybe I should just assume that either I went on a very off day? ??I admit that I do like the concept of fast Korean food, ""Gourmet Heaven"" style, where you can pick and choose from a wide variety of dishes, and the space is quite nice and clean with ample eating area. ??But the food...My goodness, I've never had such atrocities displayed as food. ??Tteokbokki tastes like burnt gruel, ??japchae was tasteless, kimbap rice was hard and brittle on the outside and again tasteless. ??If this represents Korean peoples' tastes (I assume the majority of reviewers are Korean), then thats a little frightening."
4,1,"Reading the other Yelp reviews may have spoiled my first impression of this place--I admit I had my expectations a *wee* bit high coming in for brunch one weekend morning. I, however, was not disappointed even if not completely blown away and would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking to dabble in a Southern styled brunch for the morning. This is a very popular spot located in Williamsburg not far from public transportation and while I did not have to experience a wait, many of the parties coming in did however end up waiting for a good 15-20 minutes. No reservations, so plan your trip wisely and my first recommendation would be to arrive as early as you can! Restaurant is a little tight, but they do have a back dining area and it can hold a decent number of parties. There's larger and smaller sections in the restaurant. I also have to note that I loved the music they were playing here... Onto the important stuff, Service was very rush and go given the volume and demand from the restaurant, but they were friendly and I had no issues with them. There was a quip with the credit machine at the end of my visit and we had to wait a good 10 minutes additional for the cheque, but they apologized and let us know timely. Food is really great. I highly recommend the chicken biscuit--moreso than any of the other options on the menu (given I haven't tried everything). You'll get your hands a little messy, but it's damn tasty and worth a try. I also sampled the fried chicken & waffles, biscuits, the chocolate cake donut and the sweet tea. I found all of the options pretty tasty. I wasn't blown away by the fried chicken (little dry, tasted run of the mill) and definitely have had better, but the biscuits were scrumptious and the chocolate cake donut was very filling! Sweet tea was a smidge bland--when I think sweet tea, I want it as sweet as sweet can be. Waffles were mega tasty and I loved 'em. So, tl;dr version of the food-- waffles and chicken biscuit were a total hit in my book. Get those when you come here. Try out the donuts too. I didn't get to try the pies--will come back and definitely add my two cents on those also!"
5,-1,"Walking through Soho, a friend and I passed by an Italian restaurant we've passed by for years on Prince Street. Tonight, for some reason, we said, ""Let's try it."" This is not fancy smancy ambience but it is truly delicious home cooking. Like someone's Mama is back in the kitchen preparing everything from scratch. Mostly pastas and some pizzas...we were wowed! Not only was the food AMAZING, it was half the price of any ordinary restaurant in NYC. I will be back again and again. Thank you Il Corallo Trattoria!"
4,1,Very friendly. Down-to-earth yet special. Their french inspired sandwiches and salads are delicious and made with care. The wine list is full of wines by the glass and the staff is very knowledgeable. I really like this place! Can you tell I'm tired?
4,-1,"Outstanding, friendly service, more creative than average menu selection, very cozy, reasonable prices. ??One of my favorite restaurants in NYC."
4,-1,"Great food, great service !!!"
1,-1,"Sad to say, restaurant was seriously under-airconditioned and service was so bad that we had to leave after we were seated and completely ignored for ~10 minutes."
1,-1,"This place packs customers in like sardines. We had someone from the next table sitting halfway at our table. The manager apologized at the beginning of the meal for the overcrowding, but never did anything about it. The waiters were constantly banging into our chairs and our table. The food was fine, but this restaurant is poorly managed. Better to find somewhere else in the neighborhood."
3,1,"I'm glad I finally came here. The wait because there was one, wasn't so bad, but quite surprising that so many people were up and in line by 9:15 am. ?? Either way, our table ordered three different things: blueberry pancakes, which were light, fluffy and perfect; southern breakfast which was decent, but nothing extraordinary; and the Spanish scramble which was exactly what I was looking for. ??The toast had no butter or jam to go with it, so it was just toast. The eggs with chorizo and cheese were perfect and the hash browns were good. They needed salt and pepper added to them and weren't anything REALLY out of this world, but they were decent. ??What got me was the bacon. Um..sugar coated bacon is amazing! And dreamy! And heavenly! My friend gave me so much of it that I probably should stay away from pork for a while, but I know next time to just order a side of bacon blueberry pancakes and a coffee and I'll be content. I will definitely go again maybe with friends from out of town or something, but my desire has been satiated."
4,1,"This is my go to for the theatre district! ??I tend to visit this spot even if I have no show to attend.... ??The staff here is on point and the sommelier nate is the man. ??They have an all you can eat pasta special thats insane!!! ??The 25$ wine list is an original idea that has won me and many others over. ??During nicer weather My Girlfriend and I enjoy sitting outside on the 2nd floor, plants and the overhang make it decently quite as well."
3,-1,Over priced!
5,-1,Awesome! ??So much history! ??Excellent food and spirits! ??No better bar in the world.
5,-1,"Pork belly, tuna, cheese, steak, onions, classy, colorful,wine, delicious,amazing, gourmet, special, desserts, superb octopus, are you familiar with this words? I am and Casa Mono is the place where you can say all this words and more without committing any mistake . Wonderful, thank you! A great experience..."
5,1,Best falafel I've had outside of the Middle East. ??Good and fast service--and cheap to boot. ??Also: awesome hot sauce!
1,1,"After waiting for about an hour and fifteen minutes we left. ??We were told 30 minutes originally. ??For 20 minutes we were told we were next. We watched two tables get sat and then a group who had been there for half an hour less than us sit. ??Went in and were told ""sorry we had to sit reservations"". Last time I go there and I only live a few blocks away. ??Sad."
4,1,"Why it's worth it: As you walk into Uva you are transported to a rustic style Italian villa that is perfect for a romantic rendezvous, late-night dinner or after work drink. The food is fresh and rich in flavor and texture and will not disappoint. Vibe/layout: The vibe is rustic and relaxed, with seating spread between the main room, the private wine cellar and the year-round backyard patio. This restaurant is intimate and homey, but also a bit swanky and trendy. The decor is reminiscent of a home or dining room in Tuscany with old photographs of Italy and antique mirrors lining the walls. Ideal meal: Gnocchi di ricotta ($19) F.Y.I.: Uva is the direct offspring of Lusardi's, an UES Italian restaurant right up the street, such that Massimo Lusardi, the owner of Uva, is the son of Mauro Lusardi, a Parma native and owner of Lusardi's!"
5,-1,Although they have not reopened yet I just want to say the the chopping block makes some of the best sandwiches I have ever had in a fast food place. They really take their time in preparing a very well made meal with great roasted meats and even down to the packaging with the popcorn in the packing boxes. Wow! I would have to say this place is amazing.
4,1,"Yum! We waited a looong time, but they were so nice keeping us in the loop and telling us to go have another drink next door. The food was pretty great, the service was really great, and the pomegranate sangria was so delicious. We'll be back, even though there's no reservations and a long line."
1,-1,"Some friend drag me there for a pizza driven by all this good reviews: decor is the typical shabby cliche` New York place not Italian feeling but it works here. pizza??? I was quite exited and had great expectations, the place was busy and we wait quite long for our pizza, finally here it comes: The crust was thick crispy and chewy not a good sign, ??the real pizza should be thin, crispy or soft not chewy, it also was quite small in diameter maybe that explain why it was thick! mozzarella left much to be desired. It was waxy, gummy, test and felt chip mozzarella from curd and not really a milky fior di latte that should go on a ""real Italian"" pizza, quality of that cheese was at the same level of an average pizza by the slice place. ?? I'm really don't understand how this place is rated so hi and had so many reweaves, or maybe I do but I want say it. Service was OK in line with a pizzeria/trattoria. Unfortunately it was not a good experience."
2,-1,"judging from the previous reviews, I must have gone on an off day. I went in about 10 minutes before closing, with no line, and relieved that I got there in time. I was suprised at the prices right off the bat, very cheap for a good sized sandwich! ??I ordered the pork banh mi, and was handed a sandwich that was already made, wrapped, and was sitting on the food line for who knows how long. ??It ended up being pretty dry, with not a lot of meat, and lacking flavor. ??For $3.50 it was a tasty sandwich, with a lot of potential... so I will have to go back during prime hours to hopefully have a better sandwich!"
2,-1,"The excessively long lines combined with the really mediocre ramen makes this place a place to pass over, if you ask me. I braved the lines once. Once. That was enough to make me realize there are many other places in the city with better ramen that's less expensive and served in a fraction of the time. Stand in line to see for yourself, but don't be surprised if you find the wait wasn't worth it."
5,1,"Nothing to complain about here! The food was simply amazing. Waitress was nice. Good atmosphere, easy to get a table. Try some of their appetizers whil you're waiting for your dishes. They have some interesting ones. A nice spot to have dinner if you're near the Barclays center. Would definitely like to come back for lunch sometime!"
5,-1,"Vesta has a rotating menu and you can always be sure that the food will be great! They source a lot of their food locally (Brooklyn Grange Farm in Astoria and upstate wines) and they are always friendly. Highlights (of late): the poached eggs for brunch are divine and their pizzas are always good (crispy crusts and the toppings are not held in lashings of cheese). We often come away feeling good after eating here. And, when we lived close by, would often order pizzas to go. The worst thing about moving from Astoria: no Vesta!"
3,1,"I was so excited to try another one of Colicchio's restaurants and I was a bit underwhelmed. I came here on a double date and shared a bunch of things. The bread to start was a little roll that was pretty ordinary. We shared the chorizo pizza which was probably the best part of the meal. Thin crust and delicious. For entree I got the cavatelli with short rib. Where is the short rib? There was some kind of short rib juice that you could envision the short rib marinating in but I did not find one piece of short rib. Pretty disappointing. My boyfriend got the burger which he enjoyed. I tasted the beef carpaccio which felt smokey. For dessert I tried the chocolate cake and the zeppole which were both okay. The waiter gave us little banana chocolate chip muffins to go at the end which was a nice touch. Overall, I think this restaurant was pretty but left a lot to be desired."
5,-1,If you want a true meaning of a family place to eat this is it. The food is AMAZING right on point w/ their service too. ??Each time I went here we tried different items on the menu and I must say everything is better than the one before. The desserts are all mouth watering. The sangria YUMMY YUMMY. I definitely tried everything on the menu except 4 things and everything is my favorite. I will be going back to taste the items I haven't tried yet. My kids who are 5 and 9 love this place too. ??I took my friends here and my friends words said it all She asked if she can take the Chef home with her to teach her how to cook like this. Everyone I take here always goes back with other people too. :-) I love this place....
3,1,"We stopped by to try an artichoke slice to check out all the hype. The pizza is obviously not a thin crust so you should be prepared for that as it is fairly thick compared to NY style pizza. The pizza was ""different"", probably the sauce was the thing that threw me off the most, I can't say it was bad but perhaps I just prefer a more traditional slice and flavor. My friend had a Margherita slice and I liked that better than the artichoke slice. It's not bad but its probably not for everyone, with that being said its definitely worth trying out."
5,1,"Great southern food. Loved the fried pickles. Mac & Cheese was very filling, enough for two."
5,1,"Amazing food, not well known, expect to wait a while even late at night. Seems like people who know Japanese food go there."
5,-1,"This is _the_ place - look no further. ??Food and service are excellent. ??Great atmosphere. ??Handmade pasta, real pizza, authentic Italian."
4,-1,"I love Moose Heads, Artichoke Dip, Brow Liquors, Alleyways. If you do, then go here, awesome."
3,1,"If you put ketchup on your fries when eating here, you just wasted your time and money. It's a small hole-in-the-wall storefront with a menu that consists of one kind of French Fry and hundreds of dipping sauces. ??The fries aren't that good, but I'm not a large steak fry kind-of-guy anyway. ??However, they are hot, plentiful, and the different dipping sauces turn the fries up to the 11th level. ??Somewhere on 2nd Ave between 10th and 8th, keep your eyes out because you'll miss it a few times. ??If they were open late, it would be an ideal place to cure a hangover when you get the post-drunk munchies."
2,-1,"Was writing a review for the 26th st location and decided to put my input in on this location. I attempted to come to this location a few times because its simply more convenient for me. I was absolutely in love with the other location so I thought it'd be the same with this location. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken on 3 separate random occasions, not sure if I just have bad luck. But every single time it was burnt not the actual bread but the chicken which completely ruins this wonderful sandwich. Of course I never realize until I get home and by then it's too late. The last time I attempted to be a bit smarter, order ahead and politely ask them to make sure the chicken isn't burnt. However this particular time I was told that they weren't taking cash only credit and debit, I didn't want to go home just to come back so I said f it. Also (not sure if they do now) they don't offer cheesy tots, just plain sharp tots, the other location does and it's a shame that they don't because its so yummy. Any-who I gave them 2 stars because I still have hope !!! Lol"
5,1,"Yum! I went here during lunch with a few coworkers. There were a few tables occupied but it wasn't crowded and I seriously can't understand why there weren't more people there. Everyone loved the food they ordered. I got the hamburger and it was cooked to order and so amazingly good and quite large. Their fries were delicious. Honestly, I can't say anything bad about the experience nor the food. I would definitely eat here again and anyone interested should give it a go too!"
4,-1,"Probably the best wine bar in new York City. The plates were not huge, so sharing seemed the thing which was really fun to do. The chesse plate is lovely and comes out so nicely plated -they do a great job with presentation. We got several cheeses and then a few appetizers and then an entre to share so we could taste a little of everything. The service was a little slow but we didn??t really care because we had such great food."
5,-1,"I am about to become a serious regular at this place. It's hard to find a restaurant in New York -- particularly in the West Village -- that has food of this quality with entrees priced under $20. It's even harder to find one that has a warm and wonderful atmosphere and a very friendly staff. I particularly recommend the guacamole, the ceviche, the lomo saltado (perfect short ribs+french fries soaked in short rib juice+delicious sauteed tomatoes and onions) and especially the torrejas de oliva for dessert. The torrejas is a olive oil-soaked cake with a bruleed topping and amazing blackberry sauce -- you can definitely tell that there is a serious pastry chef (Pichet Ong) involved here. I cannot wait for Coppelia to get its liquor license, since everything on the menu will go very well with a nice cold beer."
2,-1,"I couldn't believe the number of 5 star reviews this place has, so I went by at brunch to check it out. ?? Long wait for pretty ok food, pretty ok prices, decent atmosphere. Once we got sat, thing went better. ??Free drink was nice. I mentioned the waiter (who was perfunctory, but not rude or anything) all the great reviews, and he kind of shrugged and admitted that the management ""suggests"" that staff write reviews. ??That explains how a pretty average place gets such great reviews, but I subtracted a star nonetheless!"
5,-1,"My favorite place for brunch. The food is really good, the menu is exciting, they always have really good specials and the place is super cute. Try to sit outside rather than inside as it can get a little noisy."
5,1,"I thought I loved fries, then I met Pommes Frites. ??Pommes Frites just stole my virginity... like I had never tried a proper fry before. ??Ok, I kid, but it's a damn good fry. I actually have legitimate hunger pains for this place. ??A zillion sauces to choose from and they'll let you try it first! Filipino run (and probably owned?) so I'm even happier to support. ??The employees have always been super nice and friendly! ??When it's not busy they're willing to spend some time talking to me about the sauces. My only complaint is that there CAN be a long line (usually at butt o lock in the morning when the drunkies come)--its great all the time but especially great after a night out. ??Also, its such a teeny place, literally a hole in the wall, and it's really hard to get seating. PS, saw them mixing a sauce in the back and a huge amount of Patis was poured into whatever flavor he was making. ??Awesome. Hah."
5,-1,"Place is absolutely amazing, from the atmosphere to the great service to the amazing menu. You must try the goat cheese balls with the lavender infused honey---crazy good. They also have a pop-rocks desert that should be at every restaurant in the city."
5,1,"Yes, I am definitely a fan. This was perhaps one of my favorite meals that I had while visiting NYC for the first time. I don't even know how I found this place, but I'm so glad I did. Yay for my friend Michelle C. for suggesting this place. Now let's put it out there... Tasty is not a fancy smancy wine and dine sort of location. It's a yummy, quick, cheap, no fuss good delicious noodle joint. What's so special about this place? Well for one, definitely not the decor. To be real the decor is a bit blah, a little sketchy from the outside, but do not be fooled. There is magic happening on the inside. Yes the place is small, a bit dirty, and maybe the tables are tad bit sticky, but forget about all of that and order the goddamn fresh handmade hand pulled noodles. Yes, ladies and gentlemen the secret to the deliciousness of this establishment are the wonderfully crafted hand-pulled noodles. Fresh. Tasty. Perfect amount of buoyancy in your month deliciousness. The selection is huge..and you can get almost any kind of noodle (hand pulled, knife cut etc) with any variety of broth or stir fried. I personally went with the #1 house special which consisted of hand pulled noodles, beef tendon, tripe, bok choy, spinach, and a fired egg. Yup all of that in a big steaming bowl of broth for $6.50. I would say that is a win ladies and gentlemen. It was amongst the cheapest meal I had in NYC and definitely comparable to the lovely noodle joints that I'm spoiled with here in LA. I definitely recommend this place. Get over the fact that you're not receiving 5 star service and just do yourself a favor and order the noodle. OH, cash only, of course :)"
5,-1,"I would like to start by saying that I do not yelp. I love reading reviews but I have never had an experience, good or bad, that had left such an impression that I felt the desire to write a review. That is, until today. I came in for lunch, mostly because this place is close to my office and mostly because of all these great yelp reviews. I came in this afternoon to have lunch and catch up with an old friend and was warmly welcomed immediately when we walked through the door. The Staff is SUPER friendly. Second thing we noticed after being so welcomed was the beautiful decor, this place is tiny but lovely and the food speaks for itself. I had the chicken cutlet which came highly recommended by our fun and friendly server Marie. She was quite the fire cracker and made us feel like fast friends. ??My friend enjoyed the chipotle burger that was also given rave reviews. Lunch was great and wasn't too pricey and the all around atmosphere was incredible. I give this place 5 stars! I will be coming again that's for sure!"
5,-1,"I found this hidden East Village spot three years ago and haven't left... Great Latino bistro with an awesome chill ambiance where a very fun eclectic crowd of Wallstreeters, East Village artsies, ??Soho retailers, and other cool types mingle over ??amazing cocktails and tasty PanLatino food served by super sexy and friendly wait staff and mixologists... ??Don't expect an attitude or a clubby scene. Unbelievably, Yerba is a cool, anti-scene place where you can be comfortable with a date, your parents, or last night's hot trick!"
5,-1,"Absolutely love this place! ??The chicken biscuit is amazing, and the fried chicken is as good as it gets also. ??Great chill staff who is extremely nice."
2,-1,"So this place was all about gluten free. It's their big thing. I was sooo looking forward to a gluten free pizza. ??They were...out of gluten free pizza dough. Not sure how a gluten free place that prides itself on being gluten free can be out of one of the staple gluten free items. ?? We ended up ordering regular entrees-they were tiny. Very tiny. Flavor was pretty good but everybody was still hungry after the meal. ??All in all, it fell short and my group was disappointed."
4,-1,"This is the one great cafe with amazing coffee. The aussie flat white, just the best. Food was incredible, healthy, tasty....perfection. Only draw back is, too small for popularity, but still 5 stars because it is that good"
5,-1,"This place is excellent. ??Quiet, friendly and the best food in Williamsburg."
5,1,"This place had some of the best chicken and waffles and some of the best biscuits in Manhattan. After only one meal here, I will definitely have this place towards the top of my list. During this most recent visit, I wasn't drinking, so I didn't take part in the $4.00 Mimosas....but I definitely will next time."
5,1,Excellent food & service! The seafood soup was the best! Everything is cooked fresh. We are visiting from California & found all the other recommendations from Yelp extremely helpful. This is the reason we picked this place. Servers are genuine & friendly. Jonathan is from Ecuador & was very attentive to my parents. The manager is very friendly & professional. I highly recommend this place but make sure to make a reservation in advance as it's a pretty small place.
2,1,"Cleary, others have had some great experiences at Rye. ??Maybe I'm biased after dining at Northern Spy in the East Village the last few months...however, these things add up to one bad restaurant experience! -Asked for bread and didn't get it. ??Asked again and did. ??Thank god, because -Appetizers took 30+ minutes -Main courses took 45 minutes after our apps -Everyone at our table salted their pasta heavily because it was so bland. ??For only having 5 entrees on the menu and at $19, shouldn't it be pretty stellar pasta? On another note, there seemed to be NO management. ??This place could be making more money if they knew how to turn tables at least a little bit, encouraged their servers to actually ask their guests if they want coffee, and the basics! Pour wine throughout the meal, inquire about getting a second bottle!, refill water glasses which were constantly empty, etc. ??I was confused because the restaurant didn't seem too insanely busy, nor was our waitress stressed in the least. ??I see no reason to return when there are so many other great places in NYC serving top notch New American, often with more emphasis on locally grown and organic ingredients."
5,-1,"Lot 2 is a fantastic and long awaited addition to the South Slope. The green pea appetizer was fantastic, extremely fresh and, well, appetizing! For entrees we tried the chicken which was by far some of the best chicken I've had in a long time - roasted in the oven with gorgeous juices and perfectly crisp skin. The lamb sausage (I think it's cure in-house) was also excellent) and the 'lipstick on a pig' was refreshing and lovely, although it didn't have any lipstick on it. Great wines. Great ambiance. Overall a great restaurant. Can't wait to go back to and try the 'neck 3 ways'."
2,-1,"It saddens me that I have to give this place such a low mark, but I must do this simply because there is an incredibly false advertisement campaign of this establishment as ""romantic"". From all the yelp reviews calling this romantic to the manager saying its the most romantic place in NYC to the countless number of top ten lists for romantic special places to eat...they are all wrong. Completely wrong. Why? Allow me to explain... I am from Philly... a large city that specializes in small hole in the wall BYOB that are oozing romance at every corner. I decided to go to NYC with my gf to propose. I called ahead, made my reservation, and spoke on the phone with the hostess four separate times to tell her of my plans. The single largest request was to be sat on the second floor at a location that wouldn't have heavy traffic and would have a view of the fireplace. Simple request right? She said, ""no problem"". Not only were we sat between two LARGE parties who were loud, laughing, and having a great time, we couldn't see the fireplace and we were in a very busy spot. I understand that its not always the fault of the restaurant... but in Philly... the hostess on the phone would likely tell us that ""this restaurant, although romantic, is not quiet or all that intimate."" or ""Perhaps you don't want to come here, because we have a lot of large parties that night."" or simply...""All the special spots in the restaurant are already taken."" But no warning, no help. When we approached the waiter, they were nice enough to re-seat us ... in another room with a fireplace... again, however, with no view of the fireplace and next to a LARGE LOUD party of 10-15 people yelling over each other and talking from opposite sides of the table. Finally... after our drinks... we got up and started to walk out. The manager stopped us before we left and was, however, incredibly nice. He was very apologetic... offering to set up a private room for us or to put us directly next to the fireplace at a more intimate and quiet location (if not for him, this review would have one star). This was an excellent response, but at that point, we just had enough. We decided to take the offer to sit next to the fireplace, but I decided they didn't deserve my proposal to happen there. We aren't a fancy couple. We aren't an old couple. We aren't a demanding couple. Perhaps I made a mistake not to clarify my plans with the hostess/manager or not confirm the number of parties for that night... the size of parties... or clarify the difference between intimate and romantic.... but I felt like they have no understanding of the true definition of romantic. A couple of fireplaces, rooms with candles, brick walls, and exposed rafters doesn't make a place romantic. For the flannel-wearing servers and wife-beater-wearing hostess... I must say to them... your restaurant is nice... but it is NOT ROMANTIC. It has good food and would be a fun little spot to try... but it is NOT ROMANTIC. The saving grace was the manager....who told us that his restaurant is the ""most romantic in NYC""... was great, but good sir... you are wrong. Come to Philly. See what we have for ""romance"", and please... stop your false advertising. oh... and briefly to explain the acoustics situation... its loud. SO LOUD. Noise travels in every room. The single table on the first floor directly next to the fireplace is quieter... but everywhere else is very very loud. Like I said above... this is a nice restaurant, but it is nothing more than a well lit fun spot to grab some good food with friends. I post this to help future lovers make a better decision than I did when considering this restaurant and trying to find a romantic place for a special occasion. My lesson learned? Don't google the word ""romantic"" . Google ""intimate"". But even with this ... as I walked outside to see the perfectly planned gathering of her family and mine, I handed my father the umbrella, leaned down to one knee, and asked her to marry me. With tears in her eyes and rain drops around... my lovely lady said yes."
4,1,"It seems like there's been a recent boom of British gastropubs in New York lately. I've been lucky enough to try most of them with Georgia Peach and Copy Gal. Tonight, we went to Highlands. We got there early, even for a Tuesday, so it was pretty quiet, I think the place would feel really cozy as it fills up. The menu is small but so inviting, even Copy Gal had plenty of choices (she's picky). Outside of the haggis, I would eat everything on the menu. We started with a scotch egg, good spot on that on GP, I would have missed it. This egg in the rank of the 3 I've had is 2. The sausage had a nice spiciness to it and I liked the seasoning in breadcrumbs. It was served with a side of a tangy barbeque sauce, but really, who needs it with the creamy yolk goodness. I think the scotch egg might have to be on the table at my last supper. For entrees, I had the Atlantic cod with bubbles and squeak (veggies in potatoes) and a rocket (arugula) salad. Everything was light and easy, perfect for a hot summer night. Copy Gal had the Wild Mushroom Shepard's Pie. Georgia Peach had the Fresh Blue Crab on Toast and sear scallops. Both girls really enjoyed their meals. For pics and more content go to my blog, gramercygirl.blogspot.co?£á? or follow me on twitter @gramercy_girl"
5,1,"This is a real gem. I discovered this place by chance, and been hooked ever since. Prices are reasonable, service is friendly and very good, and the food is excellent. You should sit at the bar, and see the cooks do their magic in this very tiny kitchen. Going there without tasting their Rioja wine would be a crime :-) The only downside is that they don't accept credit card."
4,-1,This place has become one of my favorite places to go particularly for brunch and late night snacks. Im always sure what im going to get is gonna be good. It has been closed down for renovations and I realized how often i go there or think about going there. Sometimes i find myself walking there before remembering its still closed. Come back soon Sanfords we miss you!
2,1,"I'm only giving this establishment the benefit of the second star as the music selection was quite good. ??I'm definitely a Doors kind of girl. ?? Yes, it's homey and comfortable. ??However, that does not excuse the poor cocktails. ??Some of them were simply unbalanced--in some cases you could only taste one ingredient even though there were allegedly 2-4 others. ??Others were simply unpalatable. ??With Dram around the corner, it boggles my mind why people would come here unless they want to eat. ??Even then, there are not that many food options. ?? This was a huge miss relative to all the glowing Yelp reviews. ??In fact, our table was pondering if perhaps there were multiple bars by the name of ""Post Office"" in the immediate area and we just stumbled into the wrong one."
5,-1,"Every time I visit NYC I have one gastronomical event!! Surfisf will be added to my must return to list. Amazing food (and portions) artfully presented and mouth watering! Try the mussles made with garlic, bacon in a white wine huacatay sauce: cilantro tamale with roasted pork aji panca and roasted tomato sauce;roasted zucchini filled with crabmeat, shrimp and goat cheese!! Just a few examples from a balanced menu which includes an extensive ceviche list. NIce but simple wine list too . Great patio, attentive, knowledgeable friendly staff. You won't be disappointed!!"

5,-1,"Perfection in food form. wait was a bit long but wow, great food."
1,1,"If there were a zero star rating, I would have given it that. It doesn't even deserve one star. First of all, the soba noodles were like shredded cardboard boxes. The soup/ sauce of soba was worse than store brand ones. It had weird burnt and acidic taste. Everything was wayyyyyy too salty. Tuna tartar was blend, and when I asked for small dish for soy sauce they told me to pour the soy sauce on the top. What the..? I was starving when I got there but could not stand eating this food. The only thing I could bear from this place was their hot tea. Will never go back or recommend it to anyone. Sanitary rating B didn't look so good either."
4,-1,"Sweet Afton is a great spot. -good beer? check -good burgers? check -pickle martini?- check -creative cocktails and excellent bartenders? double check My only complaints about Sweet Afton is that the menu could have a lighter offering to balance out the delicious, but very heavy, offerings. I am perfectly fine eating their burgers every visit, but do wish there was Something that wasn't fried or cheese oriented."
5,-1,"Ippudo is king when it comes to ramen. Not just in NY, but possibly in the US. 5000+ reviews on Yelp should justify visiting Ippudo as part of any NY trip. The restaurant is beautifully decorated on the inside. But from the outside, the decor stands out in this neighborhood like a sore thumb. The front does not display easy to read signage, but the crowd outside is usually the give-away. Once inside you'll be lucky if you don't have to wait longer than 30 minutes. My favorite is the Akamaru Modern ramen which is unlike any other ramen I've tried. It's packed full of flavor and always satisfies. Pork buns also are a popular item, but are a steep $9 for two. The complimentary tea served at the end is soothing and helps ease all the richness in your stomach. For avoiding long lines, try coming right at opening times or during off-peak hours."
4,1,"Great falafel. ??Tried it for the first time months ago, and still keep going back. ??I've brought others, and they go back too. Have the green falafel, choose white or wheat pita, get some spicy sauce on the side, if thats what you fancy. ??Just do it. ??Thank me later. ??Try smoothies if you like that kinda thing too."
5,1,This is fine dining. The atmosphere makes you feel comfortable yet like you have come to some place special. The drinks are unique as well as the food. Don't expect your normal fare but surprised by something other than a twist on UHF same old thing. I will say I went for the Ocean trout (Tasmanian something) and it was delicious. The service felt a little rushed at first but e settled in to a comfortable evening.
5,1,Like really really good
3,1,"There are not many vegetarian options at this restaurant. ??We decided to come here for dinner after few drinks at Press Lounge upstairs. ??Saute Butternut Squash was only main course they had - the dish was mixture of vegetables saute in olive oil and some season. ??Regardless to say the food was good, but would have liked few other options. The best part of meal was the desert in pumpkin cake with walnut ice creak - yum!!!"
4,1,"Basically, everything was FRIED. It was all delicious, but really, I was hopping for more variety of cooking styles. But perhaps most Filipino food is fried and I'm just none the wiser. I was a big fan of the coconut rice and the sizzling sisig. The salmon chips were also delicious but a bit saltier than I'd hoped. There's a fun garden area in the back (too cold for us when we went) that has all you can drink beer for $15 (go pour it yourself from the tap). It's a small restaurant but in a great area for bar hopping afterwards."
5,-1,"I brought my great aunt here. She looked at me and said something to the extent of, ""I'd be singing the praises of obesity if I lived as close to this place as you do."" Polish food at its best. BYOB. Get the blintzes with cheese and fruit (which are actually called something else in Polish). This place is great when you are hungry and have a small budget. The stuffed cabbage will rock your world."
2,-1,"It was my first time eating Cuban food and I loved it. It was really good, and inexpensive. The place was nice and small and quite cozy if you sit by the window. My sister and I got a dessert to share, which was quite delicious until I almost bit into a piece of metal. Yeah that was not cool and we told the waitress and so she took it away. We thought she was going to come back and give us a new one but she didnt! We didnt even finish the one we had and she took it away and we had to pay full price for it. That was quite unsatisfying, and seriously because of that incident i dont think i will be going back."
4,-1,"This is a VERY small place. ??We almost walked away. ??There are about 6 tables on each of two floors and a bar on another floor. ??It's a very cute place, but reservations HIGHLY recommended. ?? The food was very good with one exception. ??My short ribs were very salty. ??I couldn't finish it. ??They were cooked perfectly and it was a nice piece of meat....too bad. ??Vegatables were cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes...delicious. ?? The service was very good and the waiter apologized and gave me a free desert. ??He did the right thing. ??The owner stopped by to apologize as well. ??I was impressed by that. ??My wife had the burger sliders and loved them. ??My friend had the seafood fra diavalo and loved it. We got there at 5:30 on a Friday and there was nobody in the place. ??But by 6:15 there wasn't a table available. ??I would definitely go back and give them another chance."
2,-1,"I don't get all the love for this place. It is small, so it is like a little stand. Tacos are really expensive. They are small as well. Decent taste, but no condiments like guacamole, salsa, etc. Fairly boring overall."
3,-1,"The food, the atmosphere, etc are noting more than average. The wine list is singularly unimpressive for such a ""fabulous"" Italian. As a native NYer I am thinking all of these reviewers must be from Kansas. I guess compared to what's available in Kansas this is fabulous."
5,1,"Upstate's way is how oysters should always be ordered from the raw bar: like a sushi or dimsum a la carte menu, with a golf pencil on a paper slip. This format maximized our oyster enjoyment since we had a visual to remember which oysters we ordered and where each variety was from. We ordered a dozen east and west--wonderfully shucked. It was nice to have horseradish on the side, a PNW familiarity, in addition to the cocktail sauce and mignonette that you'd find at other raw bars in the city. The other seafood was quite good as well, as is the draught beer selection. We were not as impressed with the overly tart ceviche as we were with the generous portion of squid, sauteed over kale salad, with a citrus/honey dressing. We were seated at a high table against the wall, which made the space feel roomier, since we were a head above the other tables. We were able to comfortably hold a conversation; the patrons and music were not so loud on a Saturday night that we had to walk away before a table was available (as at the 4 other E.Village establishments we tried before returning to Upstate). Steve, the general manager, came and checked on us, and the service was on point throughout. Our servers were knowledgeable about each brew and the oyster offerings, as well as questions like ""Is the fennel overpowering in this dish"" and whether they used the bulb or frond. They don't take reservations, but you can leave your cell # and they'll text you after the estimated wait time with an update, and to check whether you will be returning for your table. This freed us up to wander around the neighborhood (and stumble upon a new ice cream shop) rather than shivering in line. There's also a McDonald's across the street, for this purpose. Would love to return for their daily 5-7pm oyster happy hour. 6 oysters and a brew for $12! And for a weeknight dine."
5,-1,"Very delicious. ??I tried just about everything on the menu, and everything was cooked very well and very delicious. ??The tofu soups are very delicious."
3,-1,"Ok first off, this place is tiny with absolutely no elbow room but it has a great ambiance. The menu is a splattering of Indian accented food, that is well explained and presented beatufilly. I ordered the portobello duck gratinee, and although it was tasty, it was overwhelmingly spicy. Chef Mehta was there mingling with the guests and ensuring eveyone was enjoying their meals, which was nice. I also had the dessert, the hazelnut cupcake, which was really nothing special. Overall, It was an interesting experience to try, but I doubt I would go back"
4,1,"A hole-in-the-wall Cuban joint, located in the least Holy of places -- Times Square. And yes, pun definitely intended. I found this place as I was searching for something fatty to get my desk for lunch on Friday. I am attempting to implement a ""Fat Friday"" policy at my desk like I did at my past firm (since Monday-Thursday most people eat salads and turkey sandwiches). ??However, I quickly realized that non-touristy lunch places in Times Square are limited, so was excited to try this place out when I found out about it on Yelp. I only got to try to their sandwiches but boy were they amazing. It was on par with the Cuban sandwiches I had in Miami, which will be the closest I ever get to eating a sandwich in Cuba, and Margon probably the closest I will get to it while in ??New York. I also ordered the steak sandwich and chicken sandwich for my group and they raved about it. I'm not surprised because I saw them make the chicken sandwich and they literally take the chicken, skin and all, off a juicy chicken thigh and chop it into sandwich meat form. I almost switched from the Cuban to the chicken but decided I'd just come back for that next time. I didn't get to try to plates but I am sure they are amazing too. I also got the desk plantains to share but they were nothing special. One word of advice though from my experience -- the trek is horrendous with all the tourists outside, the service at the joint is slow as the hell, and the patrons a little grimmy. And by a little I mean a lot. But the food is definitely worth putting up with all that. A true hole-in-the-wall."
4,1,The servers are beautiful and the food was excellent.The view of the city from within was breath taking and the Latin beat playing in the background capped off a great night.
5,-1,"This is one of my favorite spots in Manhattan. ??The food is off the hook and they have a lot of vegetarian options. ??It is a small place, so don't try and go there with too many people. ??The only downside is that the bathroom is down stairs, not great accessibility...."
5,-1,"Went here Saturday afternoon for the Happy Hour menu and to watch the football game. ??Plenty of space at the bar and 4 tvs for our viewing pleasure. ??Our bartender, Kevin, was very friendly and a jovial host with good advice on what to order. Really large selection of tap beers which is always a plus. ??Ordered a Empire Cream Ale which was 3 dollars from 3 - 6 pm. ??My wife ordered a Greek Margarita which was only 5. ??The wine list was also quite extensive. Oysters for $1 - Superb. ??Fresh and cold. Gyro Spiced Sliders for $1 - Perfectly cooked, medium rare, flavorful. I ask Kevin the bartender the one dish I MUST try and he tells me the Octopus Salad without hesitation. ??Well, he was spot on. ??It was the most delicate, tender octopus I've ever eaten. ??Served over a bed of chickpeas, black eyed peas, and olives. I'd come here again just for that one dish. ??it was that good. We spent 3 hours at the bar. ??2 drinks each, 30 oysters, 5 sliders, the octopus salad, and mini souvlaki wraps. ??All told, the bill was 70 bucks. ??Such an incredible value for awesome food, good drinks, and a great bartender. If there is a single gripe it would have to be: We sat close to the front door, which has a mini heated vestibule. ??Only the inside door didn't close all the way so every once in a while you'd get a blast of 20 degree air from the outside if customers had both doors open at once. We are absolutely coming back and will try a sit down dinner then."
3,-1,"This pizza was ok. ??After hearing much hype over the artichoke garnished pizza, I expected more. ??Instead, i thought it was way too heavy and thick. ??It almost felt like I was eating soup. ??The margherita pizza was a nice treat however and was full of flavor. ??I suggest trying."
5,-1,"I went here a couple of days ago with my son for lunch. ??We were very impressed! ??As vegetarians, they had a nice selection for us to choose from. ??We shared an appetizer of Zeppole with St. Andre cheese and peppered honey. ??Exquisite! ??The warm zeppole with the cool cheese was great, but the peppered honey really made it gourmet. ??We also each had an entree of Crispy gnocchi with a creamy truffle sauce. ??The hand rolled gnocchi were light and cooked to perfection, and the sauce was to die for! ??A nice selection of wine and craft beer, a beautiful setting, along with excellent service give this 5 stars."
4,-1,"If I could go here every day of my life, I would. The 30's-era, prohibition vibe, live music, and drink specials are what make this a great spot to check out whether you're by yourself (and there to enjoy the variety of performances), or meeting up with a small, intimate group. The space can get a bit cramped, but the atmosphere is a groovy mix of big band/jazzy tunes, and well-lit intimacy."
3,1,"So disclaimer now, I haven't had Vietnamese food since I left LA (10 months ago) so anything I eat is probably going to be skewed versus someone who gets it regularly. Small place! Super Crowded! Cash only! I liked how the server/waitress remembered who I was by face/name and gave me menus when our table was about to come up, allowing us to check out the menu beforehand. They took our order promptly (within 3-5 minutes) and I don't blame them since there are alot of people waiting and they try and keep the turnover going. Overall its a regular Manhattan place, crowded, busy and loud. Food Wise I had the Bun (vermicelli) and overall it was just ok. The sauce they gave isnt as strong/tangy as it is back home but overall it was tasty and good portions. Spring rolls were good too, though i wish they would have crushed peanuts in the peanut sauce. Sweet potato fries.... i wanted to like these and if they were a tad bit crispier they would of been awesome... sauce it came with was good but it was just meh/ok Bahn Mi spicy brisket Tasted really beefy, tasted good. If you're thinking of Lee sandwiches crunchy crispy tasting sandwich, forget about it. This was juicy and made the bread a tad soggy but the taste good. I wish there was more crisp/contrast with the pickled vegetables inside (contrasting textures is always awesome!), but there wasnt.. so it just tasted ""beefy"". Still good though, just not great. I didnt try the pho but I think this place is a decent enough place that if I was craving vietnamese I could safely come back here. I'd probably continue to look for other vietnamese restaurants though."
4,1,"I went here with my family over the holidays, and we were all very happy with the choice. We arrived just a few minutes early for our reservation and waited in the wine bar for a while - fortunately we were in no rush. They had run out of the first two wines we chose, but ended up bringing us a nice bottle after a little while. The place was packed and the atmosphere was festive and relaxed. We had heard that the list of daily specials was long, so I didn't even bother opening my menu before the waiter went through what seemed like 50 individual specials. In fact, I didn't open my menu after hearing the specials either. I started with the grilled sardines with fava beans and red onions with a pesto dipping sauce. The sardines themselves were excellent, although I could have done with different (or no) accompaniments. Other people at the table got salads of different kinds, and my mom got beef carpacchio, which she said was the best she'd ever had. For an entree I got a pasta special with porcini mushrooms and pancetta. It was a bit heavy, and I wouldn't get it again, but the other entrees at the table were outstanding. (This is definitely a place you end up spying - and trying - other people's dishes). My sister had orrechiete with mushrooms (another special) that was great. My dad had ravioli (chestnut I think) that was also very good. For dessert we shared tira misu (eh) and panacotta with three berries (outstanding). We were all stuffed by the time we left, and all of us were happy with our meals. The service was mostly very good. The waiter was a bit pretentious, but also professional, so it wasn't all bad. The water/bussing service was very good. Overall, somewhat better than Manhattan prices for a very good Italian meal. I'd definitely go again, especially if I'm out in Astoria."
4,-1,"Excellent delivery. ??Quick, well packaged and delicious."
5,-1,"The best brunch i've ever had, hands down. And byob? AMAZING! Just make sure you plan ahead as most liquor stores aren't open on Sunday mornings. And get there early."
5,1,"The fry place! The fry place! Most amazing place to live near...deliciously perfect fries with a myriad of sauces open til the wee hours of the morning? Mmm...what genious birthed this miracle? The fries are wonderful. Exceedingly well done. There is a pretty wide variety in any given serving, from the larger steak fries to the smaller crispier bits. Quite satisfactory. The sauces are where it's at. Mango chutney, yes...the most addictive and delicious, and therefore most popular. But don't let that keep you from at least trying others!! The pesto mayo is interesting...I honestly can't remember many others because I get mango chutney so often now! But I alway try to point to a random flavor and taste it, just for fun. (They're really nice about this sort of thing...in fact, on more than one occasion I've found myself at this place at 1 or 2 in the morning, looking a little you-know, and they've thrown in an extra sauce or two for me...sometimes even extra fries...complete with a wink, of course. Those guys!) I have to say, the one disappointment I've had there has been the war sauce! After spending time this summer in the Netherlands and falling madly in love with war fries in Amsterdam, I was psyched to be able to have the same thing here in the States. But alas, the war sauce is nothing like it was in the A'dam....sad sad times. Also, always get the onion/ketchup/mayo side...it's free!! Don't be scared of fries with mayo...that's how the Dutch do it!"
5,1,"Awesome all around! Friendly staff, happy hour til 7pm and accommodates groups!! Food is delicious and the sangria is fabulous. Just a note to make sure your friends are not super late because on a friday night you have to give up your table after two hours (BUT they told us this at the beginning of dinner and still let us stay an extra 45 minutes since our group couldn't get our shit together). Such nice folks. I was really so impressed by this place, a new favorite!"
1,-1,"We arrived at 3:15 on Thursday afternoon, Dec. 29, 2006. Two young men were at the front register and one rudely said we are closed, we open at ??5:00. The place was packed and there was no excuse for his behavior. Never go again, especially if this is the way they treat their patrons. Shame on you! My two teenage daughters were appalled, needless to say we walked 18 blocks to get there."
5,-1,"This is officially my FIRST yelp review ever! I had to write about my awesome experience at Bistango. So basically, yesterday my boyfriend and I went out on a search for a great Italian restaurant in my area. At first we scoped out ITrulli who's menu looked good but was a little pricey. Then we stumbled upon Bistango. From the moment we walked in it was already a positive experience. Anthony the manager/owner kindly sat us down and asked how our day was going so far. It was a genuine question asked on his behalf so we ended up chatting for a few minutes. The whole restaurant was packed, but didn't seem overwhelming or too crazy/loud. People just looked like they were having a great time. I had no idea that there were gluten free options on the menu, so was really pleased when I saw that from pizza to pasta, even red velvet cake for dessert could be gluten free. When I asked to try their GF bread, it came out toasty and flaky and was absolutely delicious. Anthony even gave us the name of the bakery they buy their GF foods from. The artichoke appetizer was out of this world, and our main courses were delicious too. And when the bill came it was $15 less than what I predicted. Now that's what I call a great meal + a great experience! I'm going there again next weekend with family."
5,-1,"Absolutely delicious! My friends and I spent all day trying exotic meats (rattlesnake, alligator, elk, wild boar, ostrich) and The Thirsty Koala was our last stop: to try some kangaroo! We had the kangaroo filet and all agreed it was THE BEST of all the meats we had! The prices are good, the atmosphere is really nice, and the employees were all very nice and welcoming. I highly recommend it!!"
3,-1,"I like Quaint but they have to expand their menu! ??The drinks are good and I like the waiters there. ??They should bring back the calamari. ??The mixed drinks menu is excellent. ??However, as a single woman I don't feel very welcome when I walk in. ??I feel this place is more for couples."
5,1,Just had dinner and drinks at Char 4... I would roll around in their lamb pastrami and bath in the homemade butter pecan bourbon ice cream if they let me. Everything else in between was fantastic. I think this may be my new favorite!! Service was also top notch. Thank you for a great evening.
2,-1,"Bar Tano stands out in an otherwise dreary industrial neighborhood; it's an elegant and charming space with a comfortable bar and impressive decor. It offers a good range of drinks and friendly service, and if it were to stand alone simply as a neighborhood bar, it would have merited a far better rating than two stars. Unfortunately, the food, at least when I went there with my fiancee, was extremely mediocre. Mixed fried seafood as an appetizer was OK, though the white fish was a little soggy and did not taste fresh; the pizza with ricotta was completely bland, the dough seemingly made with neither salt nor oil. The papardelle with short rib ragu was equally unimpressive; though the pasta was perfectly cooked, the sauce was watery and, again, bland in the extreme. Good short rib ragu should be beefy and robust; this was not. In fact, it was difficult to tell whether meat had indeed been used in the sauce or not. It's a shame, because it's a great space and has a lot of potential. We went just before New Year, so it's possible the kitchen was short-handed (the staff certainly appeared to be having trouble keeping up on a busy night). Judging by the other reviews there appear to be some winners on the food menu, so maybe given time they'll be able to bring the food up to the level the interior would seem to demand."
4,1,"My friends and I had a wonderful dinner at La Sirene last night, from start to finish: excellent service, delicious food, and cozy space. Being allergic to all things from the sea, I was a little nervous about going to a French seafood bistro. ??Happily, La Sirene has an expansive menu, with many tasty meat and vegetarian options. We didn't have a chance to pick up wine on our way (it is BYOB), but our server provided us with a ""dial a bottle"" number to call - within 10 minutes (and for a very reasonable price), we had wine on the table. ??How great is that? As for the food - simple and delicious. ??I had the roasted beet salad, followed by the pork tenderloin with morels (which was cooked to perfection). ??For dessert, we shared the profiteroles (fantastic!) and the meringue (not my favourite dish of the night, but not terrible). All and all, a great dinner - I'll definitely be back."
4,-1,"Needless to say but this was by far one of the best seafood restaurants i have been to. Weekends are the busiest time and expect to wait for an hour or more. The restaurant is worth the wait and being only couple of blocks from my place, it was very convenient. i am not a big fan seafoods but i would have to give this place a thumbs up for the food and the environment. Service is not top of the class but it's the food that counts and you can't bea that."
4,1,"The flavors! They work It's all about the combos Trust the menu, kids"
5,-1,Super-friendly staff and management coupled with delicious and healthy food make this place my go-to. My favorite is the Bacon Chicken Cheddar Ranch but their Superfood salad is a close second.
2,1,"I went here LATE LAST SUMMER for dinner and the food was nice. Not thrilling, but nice. Now granted, I was in a foul mood and my boyfriend was downright jovial. He got the Burger with all the fixings and he was licking his chops all night. I had the skirt steak with fries and then I ordered the creamed corn, which might I add I really, really wanted, even more than the steak. For my appetizer, I had the duck prosciutto... pretty good, although not as much flavor as I expected. Well the entrees came out but my corn didn't. I had to ask 4 times for my corn. We finished our meals and asked for the check. The check came and then they set down my corn. Boyfriend tipped generously, ??despite my objections. Tasty, if mediocre, food. Service was bad. Not awful, just bad. With all of the delicious places to eat in NYC, why on earth would I go back here? UPDATE: The owner replied to my message and was so gracious, that frankly, if he offers such individual attention to ??something as insignificant my Yelp review, I will absolutely go back to this restaurant."
4,1,"Super cute place for a date! Good portions and good service. The backyard area is great, a little buggy. Area is iffy, but classic BK, becoming gentrified."
4,-1,"loved it. my favorite foods were the baby back ribs, spatzle and slow poached farm eggs. ??most of the people i went with got the wiener schnitzel (veal was the best) and had only positive things to say. ?? big mugs of beer and good wine selection. the restaurant design was amazing. ??they took the ""warm, cozy, rustic feel"" to the next level, making it feel nothing like the same ole' rustic played out look that is running rampant all over nyc right now. had some issues with our reservation but it got ironed out and the food/booze/service made up for it."
5,-1,"L'Artusi, I love you! Why do you make it so hard to get a reservation? :*) Came here last Friday with my girlfriend and then came back for some more with my partner. Yummm! I've started with the nantucket bay scallops which were fresh and so very delicious. As well as the roasted asparagus which had a fried egg on top. The delicate egg yolk mixed with the flakey parmesan cheese gave the asparagus a kick of saltiness as well as added an extra moist texture. So good! There was also a special on the menu - Wagyu beef tar-tar served on 2 pieces of warm toasted baguettes. In addition to the traditional ingredients, they added extra raw onions and perhaps a touch of jalapeno. It was probably the spiciest but yet tastiest beef tar tar I have ever tasted. To follow, I got the gnocchi which came in an asparagus and hen of the woods creamy sauce. The creaminess was perfect and not heavy at all. After downing the whole bowl, I used the bread and cleaned up all the sauce. I felt like I was in heaven! I'm going back this weekend just so I can eat more! From the pesce menu, I've had the poached cod which is served with clams and a toasted buttered piece of baguette soaked in the sauce. I wish there were a few more clams and the fish was a tad bigger but my word did they make that dish well! From the carne, I've had the hanger steak with the crispy potatoes. The hanger steak wasn't anything spectacular but the potatoes were fabulous! The outside was crispy and the inside moist. There was also a sour cream and onion dip in the middle of the plate which paired up perfectly with the potatoes (this dip doesn't come with the potatoes if you order them alone just as a side, so if you do, ask them if they'll give you some!) For dessert we had the special of the evening - rhubarb pie. I personally detest rhubarb but thought they did an amazing job. Well, I ate the whole piece so go figure!"
5,1,"DELICIOUS! Exceptional food that is reminiscent of genuine Spanish Tapas in Espana! ??Small space, but worth the wait. If you love great food, and unique dining experiences -you can't miss Tia Pol!"
5,-1,Great Sushi! Excellent service and the atmosphere is great. Definitely a place to check out if you want something tasty with great drinks!
5,-1,"been here a few times and gotta say this place is just cozy not fancy not Pretentious ive tried different items breakfast lunch & dinner with different people they all have loved the homey simple food , great flavor always fresh,small quaint little spot at a great price what is there not to like !"
4,1,"Went here for dinner on Saturday night. What an awesome spot! My dining companion had called ahead and was told to come in the earlier part of the evening, because it tends to get crowded. When we showed up, all of the back seating was taken because of some birthday party (it's annoying when people hold large parties in tiny restaurants, but whatever), but luckily there were plenty of bar seats open. ??The bartender and servers were totally cool and took care of us the whole time (something not common in hipster Brooklyn!). And the food was amazing! Consistently delicious and well paced, well portioned courses. We ordered the polenta, patatas brava, bone marrow, and cavatelli. YUM. The polenta was one of the best I've ever had, and this is coming from someone who prefers polenta grilled, not runny. Creamy, buttery, flavorful, with delicious sausage. Patatas were nice and perfectly crispy, although I wasn't as impressed with the mayonnaise/siracha combo. Cavatelli was hearty and comforting. And the Bone Marrow....well, I am a huge fan of bone marrow...can't go wrong with that one! Definitely needed more bread to sop up that rich, fatty goodness! This place does get crowded and people start queuing up behind you, so keep that in mind if you're trying to have a quiet dinner, go early. Prices are reasonable for the quality of the food you're getting. I definitely plan to go back to try out more dishes."
5,1,"Cha-An is simply superb. The space is simple and elegant. I can sit comfortably with friends for hours. The menu is well laid-out; my boyfriend especially likes the map showing where all the teas come from. When my best friend comes into town, we usually spend some time having tea here; we usually split two different afternoon tea set menus, always featuring yummy pastries and other delectables. My last recent visit consisted of one of their delicious white teas (the $7 one - I'm blanking on the name for a moment). What drew me was the description of butter and almonds. Indeed, it did have butter and almonds on the nose, and the tea felt weighted with butter in my mouth. Delicious. My friend got these amazing earl grey tea chocolate mochis. $8 for three, but like scrumptiously smooth and rich chocolate tea truffles wrapped in soft, chewy mochi. Mmm. Another reason to love New York."
5,-1,"Heaven on S. 4th. Admittedly, I never get anything but the chicken biscuit and a combo of sides, usually involving the seasonal special, but it's always the greatest thing ever."
5,-1,"Excellent Greek food (take it from a real Greek ;) with great service and terrific ambience! My wife and I have been coming here for years and love the place. Only time I don't like going is on Valentine's Day- they do a Prix Fix menu and I like to be able to select from their full menu. So, sadly, no more V-days here. But that still leaves 364 days. You'll often find us here on our birthdays!"
5,-1,It is just great to eat food that makes your body feel GOOD! i had the vegan lasagna and it was PERFECT! My friend appreciated the gluten free dishes We will be coming back!
4,1,I really like this place. Wish it were a little closer to home. Good food. Very respectable whiskey selection. Great ambience. What's not to love?
5,1,"Walk in to this classic Italian restaurant and have yourself a great meal in a large, old-fashion, well-staffed locale right off Times Square. ??The vibe here is fun, loud, crowded but still classy. ??Though I don't know the history behind this place, it feels like it has been here for decades. ?? The portions are huge (family-style) and the prices are great considering size, location and quality. ??We had the Caeser salad which had a tasty dressing with just the right amount of anchovie flavor. ??The waitress was great, and she even brought us a pesto-garlic-olive oil concoction to dip our bread in. ??Even that was terrific. ??Saving the best for last, we ordered the seafood pasta with red sauce. ??It came with a huge lobster, succulent shrimp, clams, calamari and mussels. ??The lobster was really fantastic, and the pasta was perfectly cooked (slightly more than al dente). ??Everything we had tasted fresh. ?? One entree and one salad was definitely enough food for three. ??The two of us had this excellent dinner and we each had a glass of wine for under $100 before tip. ??I will definitely be coming back here when in NYC. ??Last seating is at midnight on the weekends which is perfect after seeing a show on Broadway."
3,-1,"Finally made it to Freemans, which is not easy to find for the uninitiated but ultimately worth the effort for its cozy cabin-like northern-Idaho-meets-lower-east-side-aesthetic. The staff is friendly though I sensed a slight frown when I demurred an offer to sit at the bar as a solo patron instead of a table for two. There were plenty of seats available and for a second visit, i'll request one out of the limelight and into the deeper recesses of this rough hewn camp style dining experience. If you've been to Smiths in Seattle's Capital Hill neighborhood you know what I'm talking about with regard to decor: bring your Filson briefcase and you're in like flint... I had the Mac-n-Cheese which at 14 is one of the pricier lunch options and although it was good it wasn't my idea of mac cheese nirvana. It wasn't bad; it was just a bit lonely without anything on the side. No bread, no roll, no colorful side salad; just a small bowl of oven-cooked four cheese mac-n-cheese. Next time, perhaps the BLT which sounded good but which I passed on because of the 'raves' for the mac cheese. Okay, lesson learned. The crowd is what you'd expect, fashion types, wannabe fashion types, wannabe writer types and other creatives with their iPhones on full display. Everyone is a bit too serious with the whole experience and I guess I if schlepped down from midtown or Tokyo to lunch here, I'd be too. Staff is pleasant and helpful, it looks like they have their act together and the service was prompt enough. All in all, an interesting lunch/brunch stop on the Yelp bucket list of NYC restaurants."
1,-1,"Bad attitude. Went to Lucali for the first time. Pizza is good but the attitude is not worth it. Front area staff is pretentious. The wait was not long so that was not an issue. I asked if they have a booster seat and she seemed annoyed I asked. No worries - we are fine without. The waitress seemed like she was annoyed to have us there and did not want to bother going through the menu options. If that is too much of a bother, then perhaps you do not want our business! We ordered a pizza and calzone. The waitress neglected to tell us that they space out the orders. We could not get the the calzone until we were done with the pizza!! I wish she would have told us that early on but that is too much effort. Overall, Lucali thinks they are too good for anything and I am sorry but the pizza cannot make-up for that. This night was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had."
3,-1,"I'm giving this place 3 stars. ??That means I was satisfied. ??I think the biscuits and gravy was good. ??Could have been warmer through - coming out of the kitchen. ??The taste was yum though. Friend chicken was also yum. ??I had a pecan donut too and that was really tasty. ?? The wait on the weekend was really short - like 20 minutes. ??They told us like 45 minutes which was a gross over-statement since my party and I left to get drinks while we waited but we were called very quickly. ??Good and bad since we had to quickly finish our drinks. Also, the apple was good, but I think the Blue Stove is better. ?? Service was ok. ??I'd return here."
5,-1,This place is great for before or after shows. The deserts are amazing and the clientele are theatre performers and techs staff.
3,-1,"This place serves some good pizza, don't get me wrong... but I don't understand why so many people are swooning over it so hardcore when there are several places that serve superior fare. It seems as though Barboncino is attempting to emulate these places, and despite succeeding reasonably enough, they don't quite reach the mark of ""remarkable"" for me. Sure... I get it... hip, cool, ""boutique"" pizza-joints in Crown Heights are (were?) few and far between... and I am glad to see this place in the hood... but $13 for a pizza margherita that comes out limp, floppy and overly soaked in (admittedly tasty but still overkill on a cheezy pizza) olive oil? Even the pricy niche full-size pizza joints in Williamsburg will serve up a comparable pie for about hte same price, and you get about 4 times as much pizza. Sure, it isnt cooked in a wood-oven and served by a hip cutie waitress with smooth-jazz and indy-rock playing softly in the background... bit at least its cooked enough so that you can shove the slice into your pie-hole without it flopping apart and dumping all of its toppings into a greasy mess onto your plate before they make it to your mouth. Good, sure. Worth trying, definitely. But I'm not in a hurry to go back. You're doing well, Crown Heights, but with your light-speed gentrification tsunami, I'd expect more than good music and cute waitresses to make me feel ok about paying $13 for a tasty but generaly not-memorable personal-sized plain pie. P.s: skip the salads. If you get one, expect to pay around $8-10 for something you could just as well slap together from the grocery store for less than a buck. The $4 Yuengling pints were an ok value."
4,-1,My absolute favorite restaurant when it comes to food...Atmosphere is ok & service is ok ....And getting a reservation is like pulling teeth but besides that the food is absolutely the best in nyc
1,-1,"one word... mice. ?? will never return, doesn't matter how good the hummus was."
4,1,"I would have to say that I expect a little bit more. Food was great for sure. I liked everything. The place is very clean, services was really good, food was so fresh, and it wasn't THAT expensive like some other reviews said. My waiter did took a wrong oder from me which I ordered Tako sashimi and he gave me oyster sashimi. I didn't really mind 'cause i like oyster too, and it turned out to be a wonderful mistake. The oyster sashimi was so fresh~!! I love it, love it, love it. I might not go anytime soon again because after all it is just a sushi place, nothing too special about it expect they have high quality of seafood."
4,-1,"I thought La Sirene was an absolute great find for a delicious dinner that does not break the bank. ??I ordered the duck which I have had at many other restaurants and this was the best one by far (perfectlly cooked, great sauce). ?? My favorite part was the chocolate lava cake with coconut ice cream that for once looked like chocolate lava when you put your fork into the cake. ??All around great experience with a date. ??The only negative thing I can say is that if you go right when they open and until about 730pm, it can be a little noisy from traffic going to the Holland Tunnel."
2,-1,"Wayyyy overrated. Had the saam dinner with a few friends; it was good, but you can get that from any korean bbq restaurant in ktown. Not worth the price."
1,1,"This has got to be one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. I don't understand all the good reviews on Yelp. I like to think of myself as someone who appreciates good food, regardless of the price but the food here is not that great whatsoever. You can find this type of Japanese food at several locations in the city. The problem is that the portions and the prices are ridiculous. You will get two small cups of rice with a bit of crab meat for $26. You will get a pinch of tuna sashimi for $10. You will get a bit of Sea Urchin for $22. The food will not wow you. You will leave hungrier than when you entered. I ordered 4 plates because I was told the portions were small but I had no idea they were tiny! In the end, I paid over $50 for eating food that could probably all fit in one small regular sized plate. I left the place hungry. It simply is not worth your time or money. It isn't like some explosion of flavors in your mouth that warrants the extra money. There is nothing justifying the portions and the price. I would rather go to more highly acclaimed restaurants that offer better food and better portions at pretty much the same price. I haven't mentioned the fact that this place is in the basement of a building, the service is lousy, and the menu lacks any and all organization. Do yourself a favor: Skip this place."
5,1,I have been to Yerba Buena on two separate occasions when visiting New York and both times have left me completely satisfied. I recommend it to friends and family whenever they are in the city. On my last trip we all got a different entree and shared them. Recommendations: Lechon - Tender pork with yucca mash and a habanera mojo sauce was incredible. Just the right amount of heat. Fish Tacos- This is an appetizer but should not be skipped. The perfect amount of each component. Brazilian Paella - Huge shrimp and other seafood with coconut milk. There wasn't a drop left which says it all. Rib-eye - Marinated overnight and probably the most tender rib-eye I have ever tried. Fantastic We did not have room for dessert but plenty of room for tequila shots with our waitress and the maitre'd. The service was fantastic (ask for Claudia) and I must mention their cocktails are a work of art. I recommend you try the Poquito Picante even if you don't like gin very much.
3,1,"Probably the best Schnitzel I've ever had. Mostly because of its accompaniments. The jam, the cucumber slaw and potato salad are all on point. The spaetzle, on the other hand, was rather bland comparatively. That said, one of the non-German dishes was very strong. The snapper was delish- almost like something you'd expect to be served at Nobu. And last but not least, the decor- the true star of Edi. It's Edward Scissorhands meets barn chic. Very creepy cool. Definitely worth the change of pace."
4,1,"After a long night of sushi-ing and beer hunting, we were craving French fries pretty fiendishly. Luckily, Yelp was my go-to, and it once again led me to just the place I had in mind! In addition to some pretty legit FRITES, BXL had that nice, random atmosphere you don't really realize you need until you arrive. You walk in, nice big bar, ample seating to the right, all in full view of whatever live music is going on. Waiter was perfectly attentive, and it was nice that we were still taken care of even though we weren't sitting at the bar like most other patrons. In addition to a really solid bar menu with American/""Belgian"" favorites, there is an extensive beer list. I was happy to try out a couple of Lambics and Deleriums. No complaints, at all. Bathrooms are quaint but clean. Prices are fair. Beers are served in proper vessels. Fries are super tasty and hit that late-night grease spot (but they aren't actually too greasy :) ). Volume is loud, but not so loud that you yell at your table and bar mates to be heard; just lively."
4,-1,"such a good restaurant- it's a neighborhood staple. ??the appetizers are amazing (i love the yogurt dip!). ??the beyoglu salad is also wonderful and the dressing is so lemony and light. and of course, the warm fluffy and fresh bread that they offer with the dips is a real treat."
5,1,"Delicious food, both meat and vegetarian, with wonderful service. It's our second time there and so happy we went."
5,-1,I honestly can't understand why this place has only 1 michelin star. Best restaurant I have ever been to ever.
5,-1,"1 hour long wait, finally I am in. So, busy place. I am not sure I can wait one more time. However, the food is great. Excellent grilled baby octopus and generous portions. I had sea bass is simple and delicious and the lemon potatoes are very tasty. The seafood is very fresh."
1,1,"GIANT COCKROACH in my Miso Ramen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was the size of my thumb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I threw up in my mouth!!!!!! I was mortified and absolutely disgusted!!!!! I waited 30 minutes in the cold for this!!!!! Never again! This place is dirty!!!! ""GRADE PENDING"" on the door. I complained to the waitess and she offered me another soup! Yeah right...like that other soup is better...The GIANT ROACH was probably stewing away in the giant pot of soup behind the counter and everyone's soup is contaminated. NASTY! I said no to her and walked straight out of the place! Beware! You're pork broth might be roach broth! NEVER AGAIN! Eat at your own risk!"
5,-1,Very nice experience. I love the location.Love the Steak very tasty.
5,1,"Ohh Beco. This place is good. I had the Bife & Cavalo and the steak was cooked to perfection with an excellent seasoning. The tomato salsa was a nice touch, but that aioli was heavenly. When you add the rice and beans, it's a very filling meal. It's nice to break out of the normal brunch routine and have something truly unique. This is a great spot for smaller groups or pairs, and even though it is a bit loud, I had a great time catching up with a friend. I will definitely be returning."
2,1,"So, I plan out a day to try out this Vendy winner. On my way there thinking we get off the train at Astoria Ditmars WRONG. So we went walking about 10 blocks to find Broadway. No problem, just an error on my part. Upon arrival if you watched the Vendy stuff you expect a very warm staff, and a multitude of sauces on your food. ALONG with the different toppings and a unique taste. HOWEVER what you really get is a rather overpriced same quality meat as any of Halal cart. The one plus is that the vegetables are different as they give you pickled stuff. I didn't really like the pickled stuff, but I really appreciate it though. The debate of these guys versus the ones on 53rd? Well maybe it was my single bad experience and the fact that it takes me close to two hours to get here, but this place lost in my book. OH RIGHT, our plates didn't even come with that one signature Falafel piece they put on the side. Shake my head."
4,1,"I've lived in four places in my life. California, Illinois, Seoul, and New York City. The South is a foreign place to me. But I love their food, and I imagine this place to be like a hip/southern restaurant that romanticizes my view of the south...which, from my background, is probably hard to do, so slow clap for Jacob's Pickles. AWESOME service everytime I have been - a great beer on tap selection, and willing managers/bartenders who are passionate about helping you. I tried their thai basil ginger chili (i butchered that I'm sure) wheat and it was one of the most unique beers I have ever had, and I felt super hip since it wasn't even on the menu but recommended by the manager. Obviously it makes sense to try the pickles hence the name - and I tried most of their special pickles and first time I tried the fried pickles. I think it's worth the experience to try, but honestly I think I like their normal pickles they give to you on the house. But again, it's cool to try for the experience, they have a lot of unique pickles/veggies that will blow up your mouth. not literally. Okay, so this part is easy because I a. LOVE fried chicken b. LOVE biscuits and gravy c. LOVE bacon. so there's a bunch of choices here and they are all great - plus the cheese grits are awesome. The biscuits can be a little on the dry side at times, but overall, you can't mess up this combination too badly, and for the most part it's way above average in my view. AWESOME bread pudding and yes, massive FREAKING massive. The ice cream was a little too soft and fluffy for my taste - but the bread pudding was perfect. I do think with how FREAKING massive the portions are, if the ice cream was the rich, heavy type I prefer I'd die of diabetes. So maybe good call there. Overall, I love the ambience, the food choices, and the beer selection, so totally solid spot to go and enjoy a great ""southern"" experience. at least I think..."
5,-1,"New cafe/restaurant in my neighborhood. They offer take out and dine in. They are still getting things going, but so far I love it!"
5,1,Went here because of its outstanding Yelp reviews. Noodies lived up to it! We had pad thai and pineapple fried rice and it was some of the best I have had in NYC. Will be back DEFINITELY
4,1,It is true! The Black Label burger is likely the juiciest and tastiest burger you can get for that price tag. A thick and nicely marble patty topped with onions that almost taste like it hopped out of a bowl of french onion soup it a combination ideal for the perfect lazy Sunday morning burger. I would give the Bloody Mary a skip if you like it spicy.
3,1,"Yelp, you kinda failed me with this one. So many rave reviews about this little place, it has to be something special, no?...maybe my expectations were too high but nothing left me very impressed or eager to return. We came here on a rainy night looking for some great pasta and some comfort food. paprika seemed like the perfect choice since i've been meaning to come here for ages. I really wanted that squid ink pasta! ?? ?? The dishes are were decent portions for me but proved to be too small for my boyfriend, he left the resturant asking me if we could get dumplings from the place next door! YES,dumplings right after we had pasta! ?? As for the squid Ink dish, it was probably the best thing from the specials and we both agreed that it was tastier than the pappardelle with oxtail. The squid ink pasta is black as night and the little lobster chunks were perfectly cooked. While i did like my pasat, its a bit saddening for me when nothing else on the regular menu catches my eye. ?? One thing i really like about parika is the fact that they bring you fresh bread, olives and olive oil for dipping as soon as you sit down. I love when places give you a little teaser right before your meal. Maybe i just really really love olives? It was a nice surprise to say the least! ?? I dont know if i love Paprika, its definitely cute for a date if you're already in the area BUT there are so many places the the city that i'd rather pick for good food if given the option."
3,1,Great variety of food and drinks. Loved the tonkatsu and the beef kakuni.
5,-1,"Love this place! The brunch is stellar - though you have to be sure to make a rezzie - this place is slammed for brunch! Try the chair lift coffee and the french toast. To die for. And the bacon - don't even get my started. It's ruined me, seriously, for all other bacon. Incredible. Highly recommend."
4,1,Tried this place through an AmazonLocals deal and was very pleasantly surprised. ??Brought my 3 kids and had two dinner crepes and a desert crepe as wel as a wine and great beer (Allagash). ??I will definitely be going back though I'm a bit concerend the small quarters could get quite crowded once word gets out on this neighborhood gem.
5,1,"When I use to live in Cobble Hill, this place opened across the street from me. ??Most restaurants in New York open and have loads of people come the first month or so and then it tapers out after everyone has tried it. ??Joya has been around for a good 10 years and the crowds have never let up since their opening night and for good reason. ?? If you want a place that has a nice (low lights) look, it's perfect for a date or friends night out. ??They have gone through periods of DJ's and not but regardless the place is always jumping. ??Nothing on the menu (and it is a miracle it has remained this way since they opened) costs more than 7.95! ??(Almost to find a place this hot in New York with this low prices and great atmosphere is unheard of!) ?? I've gotten to know the owners over the years and could not meet a nicer bunch of guys. ??The food is top rate Thai. ??There is nothing on the menu I could complain about. ??Personal favorites are the Spicy Noodles with chicken. ??Mango salad (and I'm not a salad lover but this one is great!) ??And - you will see a one page list of 'specials' that is handed to you when you sit down. ??(Note: the 'specials' prices are higher than the menu's nothing more than 7.95 price - but well worth it and mostly in the 13.95 range). ??I personally love their Skirt Steak (which always seems to be on their 'specials' page cooked with various Thai style veggies). ?? If I had to say anything critical it would be that - at times it feels almost 'rushed' to clear your food and have you on your way. ??Given the high volume of people each night (Monday nights can be as crowded as Saturday nights) it's understandable why they need to keep the turn over going. ??It's not exactly the place where you can sit and talk for a while after dinner (unless you do so at their bar which in itself is a great spot to hang.) ?? The white wine is cheap and good and after such a fun night of incredibly good food - and dining - you'll feel like you just left a party and can't wait to go back again. ??Hence - the crowds - but you'll love being a part of it. ??(Note: ??if you are not in Cobble Hill and find yourself in Park Slope - go to their sister restaurant called SONG - same owners - same menu policy - same great food - slightly less appealing lighting (florescent strip lighting on walls) but all the same great crowds, fun and fantastically deliciously cheap food!) Update: ??They now have a another restaurant in Fort Green called ""National"". ??Same as everything above except the space itself is much smaller. ??I forgot to mention that all 3 restaurants offer outdoor seating - nice in the warmer months!"
2,-1,"I heard some great things about this restaurant and decided to try it out for myself. I was impressed for the area, but it still has a ways to go to impress my standards. The food was good - but I've had better in Manhattan. The service was great - again, impressive for the area. I just didnt like how they sing 35 specials to each customer. Wine list was OK. I'll give it another try sometime soon though..."
5,-1,Really great Greek food! Best moussaka-- and they have really great Greek white wine! Tough to get a reservation though.
5,-1,"Butcher Bar is fantastic! We had a dinner there for a low key wedding, and we could not have been happier with everything. The food here is delicious (oh those burnt ends!), and the service was great, too! Kathy was great to work with and definitely helped make our event run smoothly. She was very responsive to our questions and flexible about everything we wanted to do. She even called me early in the day to see if we wanted to move our party to the back garden, since the weather was so nice! We would definitely recommend Butcher Bar, either as a casual dinner spot or to host an informal event."
4,1,"My gluten-intolerant daughter researched this place before our NYC vacation and myself & three 18-yr olds all enjoyed our varied meals tremendously. GF pasta for my daughter, ??for myself, creamy bean risotto was delicious & huge. Tho vegan and GF are specialties, there are gluten and protein on the menu as well. Great wait staff and being small the maitre stepped in when needed to grate cheese or help serve. My daughter was delighted to have a gluten-free cupcake to end her meal"
5,-1,"I had to write 2 reviews about fantastic places in Brooklyn, this being one of them. The food...wow just sooo good. I had a Portobello and brie sandwich, who knew that they would taste so good together. And on another day I had pancakes, well I believe somewhere underneath that huge pile of fresh strawberries and whipped cream there was a very taste and light pancake ;-) Cheryl's you rock!!"
4,-1,"Was worried when we booked here as the reviews were mixed. ??I was concerned the staff would be rude, etc. ??I was very pleased. ??We went on a Monday evening and got a table for four immediately. ??The taxidermy was not ""in your face"" as other reviews had led me to believe. ??The staff were ??friendly and pleasant. ?? Food: ??Artichoke dip was amazing- a must try. ??Devils on horseback were also very nice. ??Fillet Mignon was good. My husband ordered the venison and really enjoyed it- tender and tasty (I do not like game meat) ??Our table ordered all four desserts-- the bananas foster was the best-- excellent and worth experiencing, the brownie took second place. ??The apple crumble and the carrot cake are not worth trying."
5,-1,"We experienced the bad traffic on the way here ALMOST made it not worth it, but the food was prepared quickly and tasted great!!! We wanted to try a another D3 place in NJ, but it turned out to be a disappointment and we both wished we had just grabbed another sandwich from here!! Great price for a very filling sandwich!!!!"
5,-1,The combinations Of food Rocco puts together are fantastic.The mascarpone cheese and fish was deliscious.I'm still thinking about the soft shell crabs with tarregon and a little hint of Anise flavor.
4,-1,"I recently tried this restaurant with two friends in from out of town who had heard of it and suggested it themselves. I love their other restaurants Hundred Acres (for dinner) and Five Points (for brunch) so was excited to try it. Overall I thought the menu at Cookshop was somewhat limited. However everything we had was very good - deviled eggs for ""snack"" and sweet potato fritters - the vegetarian pasta looked delicious although I did not try it - the Amish chicken is a HUGE entr??e. I had the swordfish which was good but small. The main attraction to this restaurant is the desserts - we tried 3 - the peanut butter and jelly sundae was delicious, the raspberry tort with basil ice cream was delicious as was the apple tart. The service was very remarkable. Overall I recommend."
5,-1,"This is by far my favorite place in N.Y.C. From the time it opened ans had a doorman named Lincoln(restaurants with doormen, cute..lol) The seafood is unrealistically fresh and so deliciously enticing. I prefer a round, ??leather booth in the back where it's a little quieter. I've always found the service to be excellent, ??the food and beverages fantastic and oysters and a filthy martini are the perfect cure for a snowy, cold winters day."
1,-1,"I tried to make a reservation for a group of 12 people for brunch here for my husband's birthday. When I called, the manager said they don't usually take reservations for brunch, and they couldn't take us at 11am, but they could take us at 10am (when they first open). I called everyone in my group, rearranged all our plans, and called back the next day, only to be told that the manager had ""talked to the owner,"" and they could not accommodate us after all. I'm a food editor and a former waitress, and I know large parties can be harder for restaurants to handle. But I always tip extremely well because I know this. And I'm appalled at the idea of a restaurant simply refusing to accept someone's business because they don't want to deal with a large party. This is just bad business, and sends a message that they don't care about their clientele. I've been to this restaurant before, and they definitely have the space to seat 12 people. The food here is quite good, but there are other places with equally good food that understand how to treat their customers."
3,1,"I wish we could've sat where all the books were! ??Haha. ??The back area is pretty, as is the decor! Anyways, I had their eggs benedict for brunch, which was on top of a buttermilk biscuit, mmm. ??That was a nice change to have, haha. ??The bacon was a bit too hard and the tiny two poached eggs were on one biscuit. ??Overall, it was pretty standard."
5,1,"After a long day, there's nowhere I'd rather be than the bar at the Farm with the steak-of-the-moment and an old fashioned. Food never lets me down, bartenders make great drinks and always have good suggestions, and the service and atmosphere are wonderful. Only bummer is the closing between brunch and dinner on the weekends just-so-happens to fall right at the time when I can generally drag myself out of bed. Bless these people."
3,1,"The Brindle Room reminds me that everyone can be a critic. Dinner here was good. The food was all tasty, the service was solid, and the atmosphere here was really warm and comfortable as well. Why the 3 stars? As I said, everyone's a critic. First things first. Food. Everything was pretty salty. Noticeably, unnecessarily salty. The disappointing part was that the food didn't need all that salt -- it would have been pretty good without it. My other recollections regarding the food were as follows: as far as the menu goes, the real winner was the chicken fried steak. We also went with the special entree duck, which definitely hit the spot as we both enjoyed the citrus glaze & carrots. Our shared ""spread"" appetizer was delicious as well -- who would have thought lentils could be so good (and so salty)? The table next to ours ordered the pork belly (ironically, a salad) and it looked really great... a must-order next time. In general the food here doesn't seem to be particularly summer-appropriate, but maybe next time I'll be surprised with some new additions. Another menu downside is the minimal drink selection. There is not much wine to choose from, nor is there a large list of beers. A few interesting cocktails stood out but we weren't feeling them. 8 decent beers were a pleasant surprise, though some of their prices were questionable. As I mentioned above, the service was very good but it was a really quiet Saturday night here, even during peak hours. The space is small and tables are close together, so be prepared to squeeze into your seat just a bit. We loved our waitress, who took excellent care of us and put thought into answering all of our questions. At $50/pp after tax & tip for a shared app, a main course each and drinks, it was a reasonably-priced meal. Is this a good restaurant? Maybe. We walked out satisfied but not overwhelmed, although I think a trip back is warranted because the menu was fairly creative and as I mentioned the pieces are all there (atmosphere, service) that could make this a very good place to dine. Overall impression: I would certainly come back here to give it another shot, and I think the dim lighting and small/cozy interior would lend itself nicely to a date spot (especially during the winter) but one thing to consider is that the menu is not particularly large, and for a date that's something to keep in mind."
2,-1,"Stay away from the Pata Confit. It's a giant hunk of fried, fatty pork with next to no taste. I knew what I was ordering, but it was way too much, and far too bland. There were no spices, no sides, a lame attempt at a dipping sauce (sugar, chili, garlic), and a large of bowl of average rice. Eating so much fried meat me a bit queasy. My $11 pineapple and rum ""punch"" had no punch to speak of. It lacked any sweet or citrus. My companion's dish, on the other hand, was excellent. They're quite new, so I imagine they're working things out, but man, did I strike out!"
3,-1,"The service wasn't great. ?? The burgers are tasty, but nothing really set them apart as far as I was concerned. Side dishes, fries, spinach dip all A++ Atmosphere is fun and a good selling point."
2,-1,"I stopped in with a friend for a quick drink at the bar before heading to dinner and the show at ??Sleep No More, which is conveniently located just across the street. The space is nice - simple and modern with a front that opens up to enjoy the breeze if the weather is nice. I love a good cocktail, and was impressed with the drink menu. Everything went lovely until ??we went to pay the bill. As a courtesy, I generally try to leave a tip in cash if I can when I pay with a card. I signed the card receipt, crossed out the tip, and handed it back to the bartender. He had a discussion with another employee, a server I'd presume but I'm not sure, who promptly handed the signed receipt back to me and informed me curtly that the tip isn't included in the charges. I hadn't even left my seat at that point, and I'd had no intention of running off without leaving a tip. That was a bit unfriendly and rude. Though I enjoyed the drinks and the space, I'm not sure I'd return. I left feeling a bit unwelcome and offended. If you want a drink before or after the show, see if you can't snag yourself a reservation at the Gallow Green - the McKittrick's rooftop bar."
5,1,Went here for a large group birthday brunch. We were quite the group and with many requests but everyone was so so helpful and accommodating! It was a great brunch!
4,-1,awesome ramen. way too popular now.
5,1,I made a reservation and was sat down immediately! It was a Sunday around 7pm and it wasn't too busy. We tried the original chicken and waffle. The waffle was soft with a light crunch. Fried chicken was great. I wasn't sure what to drink with it all so I asked for a glass of orange juice. The restaurant had a vintage feel to it and had a great music selection! Our waiter down to the bus boy were super friendly. Quick service. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to try chicken and waffles :). I wish I had taken pictures for you all. JUST GO!
4,1,"Such a great place in a very casual environment. Always busy. Paninis are large enough to share (and if you tell them that you are sharing, they will gladly put them on separate plates for you). The same goes for the soups. I love the meat and cheese dishes that are served with brilliantly toasted slices of bread ends drizzled in olive oil. Who knew that bread ends would be my new favorite things? The crepes are very good, but if you are looking to satisfy your sweet tooth, they have a frozen hot chocolate that they put an entire Hershey's milk chocolate bar into."
4,-1,"Went there for my niece graduation, and we ate the best pasta I had in a while!. The servers were nice and knowledgeable as well. Great food experience!"
4,-1,"French fries are my comfort food... so a restaurant devoted only to them- YES PLEASE! Even if I am a meat and potato kind of girl, I am happy to let fried potatos take centre stage and full plate for special occasions. And Pomme Frites is a great place to do that. The frites are just the right amount of crispy. And while I might like my frites a bit thinner (in a perfect world), these aren't too thick; so Ill be goldilocks and say that these are just right for the deal. The massive array of sauces (some mayo based, which aren't my thing; some ranch based- now we are talking...) are impressive and delicious. The location makes it a great place to stop in when you had to skip lunch at work but are on your way to a drink and need to have a bit of reserve to sop up the alcohol you are about to imbibe. It is also a great place to hit after you hit the buzz and are searching for a little bit of grease."
4,1,I had lunch with a friend on Monday. It was very charming. We had open- faced sandwiches ( ham & smoked salmon)-two women empty plates- can't do much better. For dessert we shared apricot crepes. Make sure to save room. The only complaint is that they charge for coffee refills. I didn't like that.
5,-1,"If I can give this restaurant a rating of 10 stars I would! I absolutely enjoy the meals here every single time. I make it my business to try something new when I visit and I have no complaints. Everything tastes fresh, the ambiance is extremely comforting and friendly and the service is superb. Their fish tacos are the BEST I've had, the Shrimp Penne alla Vodka makes you waking up the next day wishing you can have it for breakfast and if that's not enough, their take out is as delicious as eating at the restaurant. Everything is delivered hot and fresh. OBVIOUSLY, I would recommend this restaurant :)"
1,1,"One of my friend recommended mister hotpot to us, so my husband and I decided to give it a try, I don't know how the hell did our bill came to 115 for the 2 of us, and felt that we were rushed, not worth the price for this service and food was just ok. Not coming back again"
3,-1,"I went back on a whim and had a better experience. It wasn't that busy this time. My girlfriend had to go to a tapas place, and here we were drinking beer across the street so I knew it was there. . ??Suffice it to say that they have improved their service a bit. I only had beer this time, no tapas. I wasn't hungry, but my girlfriend seemed pretty happy with what she had."
4,1,Brunch. Spot. Vanilla bean french toast was delicious and I liked it because I don't know how to make it at home. Classic eggs benedict was okay... standard eggs benny. Benedict Johnny was yummy and a unique combination- the maple chicken sausage went well with the roasted tomato hollandaise and I liked the colorful presentation. :) Brunch includes a complimentary cocktail! Blood orange mimosa and white peach bellini= heaven.
5,1,"I love this place! Super cozy eatery with a variety of selections. There was no wait time when my friend and I got here. Seated quickly and served quickly as well. I got the fish and chips, yum! The servers are super nice. Food was delicious and reasonably priced. Will have to come by again."
4,1,"Get the 2-2-2: 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 bacon. ??BANGING! ??Delicious! ??But with Tom's, either you get it or you don't. ??If you don't, that's your fault and nobody else's"
4,1,The truffle burger and fries were simply amazing. Our server was super friendly and explained all the options to us
4,1,"Okay... so it may be sometime between lunch and dinner, and you are inkling for a snack.. Or you've been out lounging or partying and need something to quell your stomach from the booze. The line may be long here at times, but it goes quickly. The falafels here are the best around and dirt cheap.. slap a bit of their special hot sauce on it and you're golden."
1,-1,The food may be ok but the staff are rude and arrogant.
4,1,"Really delicious tapas selection. ??Everything arrived hot and tender. ??It seemed like a cook was bringing things out form the kitchen but maybe he was a waiter-- awesome. Some of the dishes (like the scallops special) were a little salty, but my friend who took us here said that it's less salty than most other local tapas places. ??I guess they want to keep you thirsty for the drinking. ?? Nice dim ambience, cool threesome tables, loud but not too, too loud. ??A nice place for dinner and drinks with friends!"
5,1,"A group of coworkers and I ventured out to BXL Zoute for a weeknight dinner. The restaurant wasn't too busy around 6pm but surely after we were seated, things picked up a bit. Now that I have had the pleasure, I can totally see why there were so many people there. The food is amazing, the prices can't be beat, and the service is really friendly! Nearly everyone opted for beers. Not one to be left out, I had a delicious and refreshing Hefeweizen. The table started with mussels for appetizers. The classic mussels were really good until I tried the Thailandaise mussels. Absolutely phenomenal. Hot steamed mussels swimming in a red coconut curry broth... and go with friends so you don't feel self conscious about drinking said broth. The menu looked great but as soon as I heard the lamb special for the night, I decided to go with that. Lamb chops with garlic mashed potatoes and ratatouille. I was sold. And when I heard the special was a mere $25, I was over the moon. The lamb was perfectly cooked. The potatoes were fluffy and not overly-garlicky. The ratatouille was my favorite. So tender and flavorful. I happily bagged half of my dinner to make room for dessert. We tried the cr??me brulee, the chocolate mousse, and the tiramisu. All were very good but the tiramisu was AMAZING. A very delicious and affordable dinner. Would definitely recommend!"
4,1,"One of the best hidden jewels of K-town. Skip the hot buffet line. Instead, go for the pre-packaged food. Try to avoid the lunch and dinner crowd. It gets really packed in there. I recommend the kimbaps and japchae. Alcohol is served in the premise too so you can get drunk on those cheap sake and cheap food (hopefully you don't hurl it all out). Also, if you come here frequently, ask for a frequent member's card. Collect stamps for free gifts!"
3,1,"This place is for SERIOUS foodies. ??Foodies want challenging food, food that makes them think and rethink. ??And there's plenty of that served up at Ssam. ??If you're not a lover of unconventional food items, you'll probably won't like this place because there's hardly any conventional dishes. Ssam is an ultra-casual, energetic restaurant that has no boundaries. ??In order to snag a table, it's first come first serve (there lies the only boundary). ??Luckily, there's a nice distraction while you wait. ??Just toddle down a short passageway to the adjoining Milk Bar, and order yourself a cookie, ice cream (flavors: cereal milk, melon and peach tea) or a slice of crack pie. ??There's even the famous pork belly buns for you to get started on as appetizers. ?? I wanted to see if Momofoku lived up to the hype. ??When I say hype, there's plenty of it. ??You need only look at Ssam's website to see their vast array of major publications fawning over their food. ??However, maybe none more important than making it on San Pelligrino's ??World's 50 best restaurants list every year, for the past 8 years. David Chang's food is original. ??Highly personal. ??And, oh yeah-did I mention reasonably priced, a startling notion in today's uber-culinary world. We started off with the pork belly steamed buns. ??Probably the city's most perfect finger food. ??Consisted of pork belly and the other standard steamed bun accompaniments: hoisin, cucumber, scallions, and pillowy steamed buns. ??The pork belly was perfectly braised; but still holding up its shape. ??Making ""mmm mm mmmm"" noises on every bite, the pork belly was tender and moist. ??The sweet and savoriness combination just totally rocked. ??This was the best dish and the only dish that has lived up to the hype. I couldn't remember everything that I ordered, but here were two others that I do remember: blackened bluefish sandwich and the sweet sour pig ear. The blackened fish was a play on po' boy sandwiches. ??Crispy bluefish filet on a toasty brioche roll. ??There's also iceberg lettuce and tarter sauce. ??The fish was moist and flaky. ??Unfortunately, the bread was too greasy. ??Texturally, the sandwich seemed too dry for me. ??And also the marinated miso flavor wasn't very prominent in the fish. ??I know other New Yorkers that go gaga over this particular sandwich. ??For me, I just wasn't crazy about it. The sweet and sour pig ear was indeed SWEET and SOUR! ??It was a wonderful interplay of flavors. ??They're cut into tiny strips, similar to those you see at real Chinese cafes. ??The poppy seeds made a nice crunch. ??But when you keep on chewing, it got too crunchy from the cartilage of the ear. ??Made it unpleasant to eat. ??It was if I was chewing on soft bones. After eating everything, I can confirm that the food is unique and well-crafted. ??There's nothing like it. ??It's New American w/ an asian flair. ??It's Michelin doing casual! ??The vibe is energetic and bustling... mirroring to the city that gave birth to it. ??After saying all that, I think I came at the wrong time. ??I was looking for fulfillment and comfort on that particular visit. ??We were hungry, and we wanted something to stick to our ribs. ??You don't really get that at a place like this. ??Hence, the 3-star rating. ??However, now that I've had time to reflect and understand Chang's concept... I'll come in next time with a different mindset. ??But not until I grab a sabretts along the way first."
4,-1,"The quality of the thai food here is quite good. I had the pad thai here, it is just like I remembered it from a short stay in Thailand. The service is hurried and not paying too much attention. The place gets very crowded in the evening, and is definitely not great for a romantic dinner. Good value for money though."
4,1,"I like this place a lot, hypey or not. It's a lot of fun, the service is prompt and friendly, the prices are in the realm of the real for what you get, and the food is wonderful. Great pork, crawfish, sashimi, bread, butter & beer (i like that sweet rice beer - what's it called?). The steamed buns are super tasty and equal to the best anywhere in Chinatown, albeit 5x as expensive. It's cramped and noisy but if you're in the mood for that kind of thing, it's perfect. They couldn't accomodate my request for a bo ssam any of the 3x I have been in NYC, so I've missed that (they say they don't take reservations for it, even if I paid in advance, and run out by late night, which was the only time I could come and eat). Maybe some other time."
4,1,"I can't believe I've lived in the E. Village for over 4 years and yet have only recently visited this place. I guess that's New York right? I'll try to keep this one short so- Loves: the kale salad, homemade seltzer, poached egg sandwich- atmosphere/local ingredients +++ Dislikes: I really don't have many complaints about this place except that the prices are a bit steep (local food-so its understandable) so I can't come here as often as I like. Nonetheless, a great find which seems to have a significant following as well? It was amusing to watch the number of people come in and buy milk and eggs during dinner-you just don't get that other places. I will return!"
4,-1,"I was there two weekends ago for brunch. ??Their sugar cured bacon was off the hook - as was there pancakes. ?? Considering that it is winter though, I am pretty frustrated with having to wait out in the cold for an hour and half to get in. ?? I just pinged these guys to add Clinton St. Baking to their service: takesreservations.com. Check them out."
5,1,"Simple. Awesome. Kind. All that and its affordable. This guy puts these hipster cafes to shame and all for half the price. I bought a tasty, hot, large coffee and a fluffy, fresh scone for 3.25. WHAT? Yes. I work at a cafe and came here on my day off for a coffee and the decor matched the service and price. Simple. Kind. Awesome."
4,-1,"Had an amazing experience at Ardesia a few nights ago. ??The service was very attentive and unpretentious. ??The music was great. ??I noticed a Hungarian white on the menu and before I could blink the bartender had poured me an extremely healthy taste. ?? The food was way above my expectations. ??Small portions but perfect for two people to share over the course of a few hours and a few glasses. ??We chose brussels sprouts, cauliflower, wittewurst and goat cheese crostini. ??Every choice was absolutely perfect. ??The sprouts had been braised in lime and fish sauce and I am still craving them at this moment. ??If we had just ordered that and our wines the night would have been a success. When the weather turns nice expect the outdoor patio to be packed. ??I hope it is. ??I hope I will be returning to Ardesia again and again over the years. ??It is a nice dose of cozy!"
4,1,"For first timers that are really hungry I recommend the falafel trio. Comes with 9 falafels ?? ??made with 3 different recipes. Served with lots of fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, hummus, coleslaw. The restaurant itself is clean and has a calming atmosphere. It's a nice fast-casual place to take your lunch break."
5,-1,"I recentley moved to the area, but i am NO STRANGER to Tom's! LOVE this place. Definetly has an old vintage, cozy feel. The staff are extremely friendly, and so is Tom. This is a must try and landmark for the prospect park area. :)"
5,-1,Had a great dinner there last night. ??One of the best italian restaurants in Astoria! The veal raviolis were incredible! Must try!
4,1,"Overall it was probably more of a 3.5 but I do like the space and the service was great so I rounded up. I had been here once before just passing through Brooklyn for an event and just had a few apps at the bar, which was enough to make me want to come back and try more. We had the Pork Morsels and Brussel Sprouts with thick cut bacon to start. ??The pork morsels were good, nothing to rave about, but I give them points for creativity, it's nice to have something different. ??Same goes for the brussel sprouts, I actually really like this dish, it had thick bacon, although not as ""crispy"" as I like it, but overall very good with an excellent cream sauce. ??Solid dish. For dinner we had the shrimp and grits, the grits actually wowed me more than the shrimp, very tasty as far as grits go. ??We also had the brisket and I had a side of mac and cheese and the kale salad. ??The Kale was a bit on the bland side but there was no salt and pepper on the table which may have helped a bit. ??The mac and cheese was very very tasty, however, it looked like it was scooped from a casserole dish that had been sitting around for awhile pre-made, it just wasn't that melted cheesy goodness i would expect? ??Nonetheless I ate all of it and really enjoyed it. ??The Brisket was also tasty but slightly on the dry side? ??It was sort of shredded and the ends were crusty which I actually liked, but not every brisket lover might like 'well done' pieces like that. ?? The cocktails were probably the highlight for me, we had several of the Bourbon bonnet, which was exceptional, and this is coming from a non-bourbon drinker. ?? I would say overall it's a nice atmosphere, good drinks, and decent food. ??Worth the stop, but will you be running back for more? Maybe, maybe not."
5,1,"This place is AWESOME! I honestly don't say that about many places. It has a very cozy atmosphere and the food is delish. I definitely recommend the fried artichokes. I crave them, they are unlike anything I've ever had before. I usually get the steak which has always been great and perfectly cooked. The butternut squash ravioli is amazing as well. I'm sure there is nothing on the menu that you would be disappointed in. I just happened to check this place out one night because it is right around the corner from my house. Thank goodness I did. Now it is a staple of my dining out experience."
4,1,"Although I'm neither vegetarian nor a strict organic diner, I still like to find restaurants that take pride in fresh food. Ellary's Greens really worked for me. First, the restaurant itself is inviting, with its high ceilings and lofted shelving filled with green plants. The tables are a bit tight but typical for downtown NYC. The chairs looked more like bar stools yet they were more comfortable than they looked. There is a bigger community table in the front for those looking for a more social experience. Service is friendly and professional. I wish more restaurants understood the fact that smiles and common courtesy make people want to return; good job with that! The menu includes both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. We sampled both today. Our food arrived to the table looking very appetizing. The chickpea burger is obviously homemade, as is the roasted tomato topping. The BLT has a decent portion of bacon that is house-cured without a spec of preservatives. Both dishes had greens that were super fresh. ?? The brunch menu has some of the regular menu offerings, but not everything. All in all, this was a very good experience, perfect for a calming lunch, brunch or a light dinner, and I would certainly return and try more."
4,1,Hope Garage was a great decision for brunch on a lazy Sunday. It does get bust fast so you should make a reservation if your party is more than 2. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. I would and probably will go here again for brunch.
5,1,Amazing for any meal! Great drinks too.
2,1,"Something happened to this place. The chef must have left. Food is no where close to what it used to be. Papaya salad is neither crisp nor fresh. The rich flavors I was used to haven't been there the last 3 times I've gone. Even the different groups of friends I went with each time made the same comments. Still great vibe and prices, but the quality of the food is just not there anymore. Disappointing. Looks like I'll be going to Pure Thai a few blocks away. Or to Thai Market on 107th street."
4,1,"Beautifully decorated, great ambiance, clean and fresh food. ?? Small and homie so it made it a little noise."
4,1,"I am intensely mayo-phobic, so I refuse to eat anything that looks like there is even the slightest chance that it might have mayonnaise in it. Since most Yelpers seem to drench their food in white sauce, I needed to check out King of Falafel and Shawarma myself to see whether the chicken and rice plate would still taste good on its own.* It does. The chicken is nicely seasoned and gloriously free of any gross fat, the pickles add a refreshing touch, and the little falafel on the side has great texture. I love spicy food, so the hot sauce added the perfect amount of tangy heat. My one complaint might be the rice, which seemed a tiny bit under-seasoned to me. But at $6 a plate, who can complain? This is perfect, hearty, comfort food for a cold winter day. I'll definitely be back. *Disclaimer: I do know that, technically speaking, ""white sauce"" for falafel or shawarma should just be some combination of yogurt, tahini, lemon juice, garlic, and/or seasonings. But that sauce is white, I'm paranoid, and unless I can independently confirm there is no mayonnaise in it I'm not going to eat it. It's a phobia, alright? It's not supposed to be logical."
4,1,"A crowded restaurant that exceeds its reputation in service, food quality. ??When our party arrived on a ""Yelp made"" reservation, we were seated on time with virtually no wait. ??Food was excellent and my spouse ate the excellent veal chop. ??Wine list was excellent. ??Highly recommended for pre show dinner. ??Enjoyed the gelato dessert."
4,-1,"I've lived up the street from spot for a year and a half now. ??As a neighbor, they get respect for having live music that doesn't go too late or too loud, and for generally being friendly people from day-to-day. ??Just took more out-of-town family here for dinner, so I want to give it some love. ?? FOOD: Gonna be honest. ??I really only eat their appetizers. ??The empanadas are crunchy, greasy (but not too), and come with chimichurri dipping sauce which is stupid. ??Yucca fries, chorizo bruschetta, and the daily ceviche are all worth trying. ??Last night, we went for the trucha stuffed with crab, fried red snapper and lechon asado with yucca. ??Delish. ??Couldn't even finish half of the lechon and it is even better the next day. DRINKS: This is a mojito to remember. ??It is good. ??Not too strong, or too sweet. ??Their other signature cocktails are also pretty tasty. ??The Hemingway is a favorite. ??You'll want to try more than one. ??Skip the sangria unless you love overpaying for sangria. ?? SERVICE: Especially on weekends, service vaccillates between aggressively attentive and completely absent. ??Can be irritating unless you know what you want before you sit down or need 15 minutes to decide. ??Servers are pretty slick upsellers too. ?? AMBIENCE: There are 4 dining areas in Cuba (four!), so it really depends on where you end up. ??The main dining room opens out to the street and is also home to the cigar-roller and live music, so that's more of a party. ??The other 3 dining rooms are smaller and more intimate. ??If you have a choice, aim for the back dining room on street level (not the basement). PRICE: It's up there - $50/person with tip for a full meal (if you're a drinker). ??Try to go on Monday, when they have $5 drinks and appetizers in the 'hemingway room' downstairs."
4,1,"a must try.. they have very fresh food in this place, they shop fresh on regular daily basis from the market... you can taste the freshness... and the service was great as well...we also enjoyed the waiters recommendation on the wine..."
5,-1,Incredible. Get there early! I take people here to impress them.
5,-1,Had many a great night in Mollys!! You just can't beat it on a cold winter night. It's a bit quieter in the summer but it gives you a chance to hang out longer and enjoy the atmosphere. The food is amazing and the waitresses (Joanne and Vicky?) are a riot. Will definately be back soon.
3,1,"A friend recommended this place with a spittle-flecked enthusiasm that made it impossible to say no. If it weren't pointed out to you, you'd have no idea it was so well-loved, although I do love learning about great places in this part of Chinatown, so I was happy to give it a try. Everything was much as you'd expect, from the lighting (surgically bright and industrially grim) to the service (solicitious to the point of oppressiveness) to the arrival of the food (on the table practically before you could finish closing the menu). The least appealing aspect of the experience for me was the styrofoam cups in which water (by request only, natually) and tea are served. I know, finicky. Every (laughably large) photo on the laminated menu makes the pictured dish look completely repulsive, sometimes not even like food at all. The only way it could be less appealing is if they had dumped the soup on the sidewalk and then photographed the result. By this point, my expectations were sinking pretty low, despite my normal incurable optimism. And sure enough, in the end I didn't think the soup lived up to the hype. Admittedly, my friend's favorite dish is the chicken curry soup, and it did seem pretty good. I ordered wonton egg noodle soup, and it couldn't hold a candle to the wonton soup at New Chao Chow, at Mott and Hester. Likewise the homemade hot sauce -- New Chao Chow's is a different level of good. Another friend's pho was fine, but nowhere near as good as what you'd get at Pho Grand, for example. ""Vietnamese"" spring rolls were dense and too oily. I guess the schizophrenic Vietnamese/Cantonese character of Bo Ky makes it a good compromise for a group who can't choose between the two cuisines, but nothing I tried was extraordinarily good."
5,1,"I'm hardly ever motivated to write reviews, and usually, when I do, I'm moved by negative experiences. This is one of those rare times where I'm so completely pleased that I had to tell everybody how great this place is! I'm a Fellow Brazilian, born and raised in Rio de Janeiro with an amazing cook for a mother; so, when it comes to judging Brazilian food I can be hyper-critical. I've been to fancy Brazilian places in manhattan, ""authentic"" places in Newark etc, but never have I found a place as delicious and fairly priced as this one!!! Everything is amazing, from the steaks, to juices and even their cakes. You will not regret your visit! And I bet you will become a regular."
4,1,"Nice bar, bit of a retro feel, much better than most garbage in this area. Got a bucket of Miller Lite which was a lot of fun, ice to keep them cold and just $18 for 5 beers - not bad. Good service, nice big TVs with sound for sports. Pretty decent"
5,-1,"simple creations, exquisite fresh taste. One of my favorites, Definitely coming back, although would not mind if the wait was a little less long (one hour for my table of 4) ?? but loved the baby shark with lemon on top (heavenly) and the lemon potatoes were too good :D service was okay."
5,1,"For a displaced Cuban, coming to NYC and north Jersey is like a breath of fresh air. It is so hard to find any quality food outside of Florida but Margon does it right. They have all the Cuban essentials on the menu and everything we ordered is just like how my grandma and mom make them. It is a nice place to go for quality food and to escape all the chains which inundate Times Square."
4,1,"Intimate spot with great food and good drinks. Good for a date. The space is really interesting and original - it has a very warm atmosphere. It can be tough to get a reservation too close to the time when you would like to dine, but they have a chef's table where you can eat. The food is very well done ??- the crispy duck breast was very tasty and fresh. Not overloaded with flavor, but very tasty. The drinks are good and they have a nice selection."
5,1,I loved Cookshop! The atmosphere was awesome. I loved the clean and simple decor. The portions are perfect. We went for brunch and I got the the blueberry pancakes. They were probably the best I've eaten. Service was impeccable too. I highly recommend Cookshop.
4,1,"Carino of Brooklyn is a cozy eatery off the beaten track. ??As you enter, it is not hard to imagine yourself taking a siesta in Spain because the atmosphere is so relaxed. ??The service greets you with a smile and helps to explain the menu. ??The menu is a Mexican based but familiar to the average foodie and vegetarian friendly. ??Since the lunch service is mostly tapas, it is a great experience for a bunch of friends. ??Sharing is encouraged, so don't worry about if you don't like it, chances are someone at the table will. ?? The only salad on the lunch menu is the Carino salad made of carrots, celery, jicama, beets and baby spinach dressed with a jalape?¡Óo dressing topped with smoky pumpkin seeds. ??The salad is so pretty, you feel bad destroying it. ??Trust me this salad will be destroyed! The dressing isn't overly spicy and the smoky pumpkins seeds add an interesting note of flavor which confuses your taste buds. ??Small plates include Picaditas which are tortillas topped with salsa verde and a Mexican cheese similar to queso blanco. These are not tortillas as you know it; they are crunchy outside with a smooth and creamy inside. ??If all your friends are not vegetarian, they offer Taquitos Dorados which come in potato or chicken. ??The prices range from $4 to $10 for each dish. ??Oh don't forget to try the Elote which is grilled corn on the cob rubbed with butter and rolled in chili powder. ??Can you say YUM? ??While you are there, don't drink the same old thing; try their imported Mexican soda or their fresh juices. ?? As for dessert, ask the waiter what is available because not everything on the menu is prepared for the lunch service. ??By the time the meal is over, the small plates make you feel like you ate a great plate. ??Tapas are a great lunch break from homemade salads and vegetarian frozen meals."
3,1,"Just don't like when people hype something up because it takes something that is probably very good and just makes it ok. The black label burger was good but it wasn't great. Maybe I'm too new school but I need a different flavor for a burger to blow me away - blue cheese, bacon, mushrooms, something. Dinner: ??Bone marrow (ok) ??Black label burger (good)"
5,1,"Learned about Totto Ramen through LivingSocials email distribution. ??Walked over one day during my lunch break. ??I wanted to get take out, but they don't offer it. ??However, the host made sure that I got in and out easily because he was understanding of my time crunch. ??I ordered the Niku-Ramen which has a lot of meat and comes in a bowl twice the size of the other dishes. ??It was delicious!!! The atmosphere was pleasant! The cooks and host and wait staff are all in good spirits, singing to the music that plays and just there to make it an enjoyable experience for you. ??I suggest when you go you sit at the bar and where you get to watch the cooks!! ??Very pleased and will make it a regular lunch spot."
4,-1,"The only reason I hesitated writing a review is because I want this to be my best kept secret. I am absolutely in love with everything that juliana's has to offer. Service... From the moment we walked in, everyone is so kind! They have a small staff but are quick to help the moment they are free. The owner is there almost every evening and is kind beyond words. It's such a refresher compared to a lot of service here in the city."
5,-1,"Perfect Place, Perfect food. Tiger Fish...... Perfect, Just perfect."
4,-1,"From the beautiful interior to the attentive staff, topped off by exceptional food and you have a great restaurant. Try the Brussel Sprouts and Atayef & Veal Bacon which are our favorites each time we go. The wait staff is very good with recommendations. I suggest going with the small plates so you can experience a variety of great Mediterranean food. Excellent wines as well. I highly recommend ilili!"
4,-1,"Amazing bar. Have a large choice of wine, wiskie and have a nice workers. can meet with friends and have some meeting there too."
4,-1,"The food and the presentation were excellent!! Unfortunately, our server wasn't friendly. He was tall and looked miserable. He never smiled and I wondered if like serving us. It was dark and dreary and the space downstairs was way too tight. Otherwise excellent food and friendly hostess."
4,1,"After reading all the reviews I decided I had to give the place a shot. I have to say the service inside was terrible and there was a bit of a wait considering your just slicing meat and putting it on bread. After waiting 10 mins at the location the guy comes from behind the counter and tells me he lost my receipt and asks me what I ordered again... 15 min wait and I had my food, got home and...... I will definitely be going back again. Might try and call my order in next time though."
5,-1,"This is the best street meat in the city!! ??$6.50 and you get a huge plate of chicken or lamb or steak with rice and a salad. ??I have heard rumors that the tomatoes are from Tony's own backyard garden at home. Seriously its a street cart so dont talk about the service or the people or the ambiance cause it doesnt matter. ??Go and stand in line, give them your order, get it and leave. ??You will be amazed at how good the food is here from the platters to the burgers and everything in between. If you are looking for good, inexpensive food in a hurry this is the only place to go in midtown. ??warning tho his line gets crazy at lunch time as all the office people around there go here to eat. ??So sometimes the wait gets really long, like down the block long but dont get discouraged or impatient. ??The line moves really fast and the food is more than worth it!"
4,1,"My friends and I arrived for dinner on a Sunday evening at 8 and only had to wait about 20 minutes. The new space is very large and is a nice space for a small to medium size group. We all ordered the soon dubu, which took a bit of time to come, but the unlimited starters helped in that regard. They aren't really the best tasting ones I've had before, but they are decent and freely flowing. The tofu itself was really good (I had the kimchi with pork), and it's not terribly expensive. It's a nice place for a meal, and definitely worth a return visit, although it seems like you might need to wait if you go at a more normal dining time."
4,-1,"This turned out way better then what I expected it to; the night didn't begin very well. During the day I was called to confirm my reservations and was told I would only be given a 15 minute grace period and then my table would go to someone else. I rushed through traffic coming all the way from upper Manhattan and made it there just on time, to then be told they didn't know how long I would have to wait for my table. Apparently there was a large party that had been sitting there for about 2 hours and they could not rush them out as the hostess told me. We then asked to speak to the manager and Lance came to the rescue, he apologized for the wait and immediately set up a table for us. He put the first round of drinks on the house and a dessert platter since I was there celebrating my birthday. The food was amazing, the drinks were delicious and strong and the desserts were finger licking good. I would go back there in a heartbeat, and of course thanks to Lances amazing attention and service he made the experience even better.Great place, thank you for making my birthday celebration amazing, the only thing I missed was the little card at the table saying Happy Birthday with my name :-( other then that it was great."
5,-1,"I love their pork burger!! I tried at Brooklyn Bridge park. I ate two big ones (trying to forget that I'm in diet ??=p) Try to arrive earlier for Brooklyn bridge park, after 2pm, the lines are crazy. Small burger definitely not enough for a skinny girl, coz you gonna love it too!"
3,1,"The space at Church Publick doesn't quite flow, with odd seating arrangements inside (both around the bar and also upstairs). But there were a few booths in the back by the restrooms that looked like curtains could close for privacy, which is pretty cool. And the food was unique and fun...especially the Rosemary Truffle Popcorn. It was all just a bit expensive ($7 for the popcorn...it's more affordable at the movies) and not as ideal for happy hour as I wanted."
4,-1,"this is my favorite greek restaurant on ditmars. My favorite is the grill squid and shrimp. only thing is that me and my girlfriend wait for almost an hour, and was quickly rush by the waiter to pay the bills."
4,-1,"Ramen is pretty tasty. ??Definitely go for the meat lovers special. My primary issue is that the wait is too long which is not helped by the fact that people just don't eat and get the f*** out of the restaurant. ??In japan, you sit, slurp, and get out. ??No dilly dallying. ??Getting ramen is a transaction. ??In and out. ??If you want ""ambiance"" go pay more money at a momofuku joint."
4,1,"Bo Ky is one of my guilty pleasures that I hate admitting to because the place just isn't spectacular in any particular way. ??But what they do make, has the look, feel, and taste of a dirty street-side taiwanese restaurant and that brings me a weird sense of comfort. ?? The three dishes I normally rotate are: 1. ??Pig Feet over rice $5.25- it's stewed pig feet, the kind they have in those big pots of soy sauce. ??Intensely salty, soft, slightly chewy, bite chunks off and spit out the bone. ??If you're chinese/taiwanese, this will taste exactly the way you expect. ?? 2. ??Beef Tendon noodle soup- $6.25- the soup is tomato based, and noodles are the flat white ribbon type (ho-fun). ??A pretty big, filling bowl for the money, and they give you a TON of delicious, soft, guey tendons. 3. ??Quarter Duck $4.75- their duck is not crispy at all, and is stewed in sweet soy sauce for an almost buttery texture. ?? While nobody is going to be wowed by this place upon first visit (especially from the decor), I've seen several regulars who, like me, keep finding themselves coming back for more :)"
3,1,"3.75 stars. ??I stopped in at L'Artusi during my last business trip to Manhattan. ??First, a disclaimer: ??if this place were in Memphis (where I live) it would get an easy 4-plus stars, but in NYC my standards are higher. The atmosphere is great: ??spacious for the West Village, three different bar areas, comfortable stools, and inviting decor. ??The butter lettuce salad I had was gorgeous, but the generous covering of gorgonzola was overpowering. ??The sausage and pancetta gnocchi was everything I thought it would be (salty, manly, filling), even though it lacked any extra dimension. ??I was pleasantly surprised when the chef sent out a complimentary tasting of his parsnip ravioli, which was subtler and generally fantastic. ??The braised quail was the most disappointing dish I tasted -- a little rubbery and drowned in balsamic -- but the accompanying brussels sprouts were perfect. ?? Don't get me wrong -- I still enjoyed my meal (and the overall experience), but almost everything was just a little off balance. ??Less hammer, more scalpel."
4,-1,"Food: ??Great! ??Pork buns are very flavorful; definitely better than the pork buns at Totto Ramen. ??The duck sukiyaki was pretty amazing as well, especially the noodles used with it. ??The akamaru ramen was pretty awesome, you can definitely taste the miso throughout the broth; though you could also couple the broth with the noodle from the sukiyaki -- that would be the way to go! ??Would definitely come back for the food. Service: ??Excellent! ??The wait staff are attentive, and they keep our water full periodically. ?? This was a fantastic restaurant and am happy to have my first review on yelp be on this restaurant!"
5,-1,"Last Friday night, my hubby picked me up from my practice and we were hungry and lazy. We decided to try Hu Kitchen, since it is on our way home and my dear friend has taken me a month ago and I really liked it. The place is absolutely gorgeous, clean and beautifully decorated and warm. But what I love the most about this place is the amazing healthy choices that are available. When we think of healthy, we usually think of tasteless...far from the truth in this place. The quality of the ingredients and menu are delicious, and great for anyone, whether you have a particular food requirement due to health or you just want to enjoy a wholesome, full of nutrients meal...btw, the prices are beyond reasonable for the quality that you are getting, trust me on that one! The staff is very friendly and kind and they really support you on any questions that will ensure you have the best experience ever. You order your food, they give it to you served in beautiful plates, you pay and then go sit either at the bar, on the main floor or you can go upstairs which is beautiful and you have the view of the whole place. As we were walking out ready to leave, my husband spotted the Mash Bar, which is the dessert bar....and let me tell you, it was the most yummy and super healthy dessert we have ever tasted in our lives. We order The Bonito and we decided to sit at the bar and enjoy it, while chatting with Ben, one of the owner, who was very pleasant and kind. We are so grateful to have the opportunity to enjoy really good, wholesome, healthy amazing food and we are going to make it a tradition for our Friday nights from now on. Thanks everyone at Hu Kitchen, you rokc!!"
4,-1,"So delicious. Everything here was uh-mazing. I'd say order everything but that's unrealistic. ?? Love the ambiance, pretty cozy with soft lighting and the requisite candles. The seating may be a bit claustrophobic for some (my girlfriend included) but you're not in danger of constantly bumping elbows. Now for the important stuff: the food. The ceviche was mediocre; I feel like I've had better elsewhere. Everything else was great. Based on the fantastic food and service we enjoyed here, we will definitely be back."
4,-1,"The take out was great. We ordered the mozzarella di bufala and chicken parm, both were delicious and the packaging for delivery worked well - the mozzarella/basil/tomato stayed in place. ??Definitely will be ordering again."
5,-1,"Super tasty plates and yummy sangria!! Not good for any more than four at a table which makes for a cosy setting. Will definitely return, soon."
4,1,"Met up with my two friends and they wanted burgers, so I of course consulted my Yelp app. ??The first place that popped up in proximity was Mark and I must say we were more than pleased with our find! ??This place is like a tiny hole in the wall, but the sliders were legit! ??They only serve sliders and fries here, oh and chili. ??But the sliders are large and a juicy and amazing. ??Also, the cheese fries are so good - they layer the cheese and so you get some with every bite. ??Not to mention the cheese is a little on the sweet side so it makes it a little more interesting. ??They have a decent beer selection... normal, dark and wheat is how I would describe it. ??We each ordered a different beer and were pleased. ??The bathrooms are surprisingly very clean. ??Hooray for sliders!"
4,-1,"This is just a really great bahn mi place. i have not had one bad experience here, the service is always great and quick. One of the more exceptional places in Elmhurst. After trying a few of their stuff, I always go back to the bulgogi bomb me, get if if you haven't yet! The only downside to this place are their drink offerings and their weird sandwich ingredient arrangement, you never really can get the perfect bite lol. I would pass on the in-house drinks since you can get a better version of nearly everything there within a few blocks. The price is spot on for the value. All in all a great spot to eat at if you're around the area."
3,1,"Went for dinner on a Friday evening - enjoyed the experience overall though the food varied along the spectrum. ?? Service was excellent - our server had a way of describing every dish in the most delicious way that we wanted to order everything. ??She was attentive and knew when to come around at all the right times. We started out with the bone marrow, grilled scallops and portobello mushroom mousse pot. ??Bone marrow was ok thought not nearly as good as the one from Blue Ribbon. ??The marrow was not warm enough and hard to spread over a piece of toasted brioche. ??Scallops were my favorite among everything we ordered - the creamy cauliflower puree, golden raisins and pistachios created the perfect flavor and texture balance. ??The mushroom mousse was not quite what we expected - the whiskey jelly was sweet and spreading the whole thing on a piece of grilled sourdough bread felt like I was eating breakfast food. ?? As for the entree, I ordered the grouper. ??Loved the crispy skin on the fish but would have preferred the center to be a little less overcooked. ??Portions were on the smaller side for this dish but just right for someone without a huge appetite. ?? The ambiance is trendy and stylish yet warm and comforting, perfect for the winter - and is conducive to a fun dinner with a group of friends. ?? I'd probably go back to try their brunch or even just to grab a drink at the bar."
5,-1,"a classic bar! dark, places to sit, can actually hear yourself speak, and the menu has PAGES of affordable whiskeys, bourbons, and ryes. (YES) most of the names I have never heard of before, being as they all are from small American distilleries, but I was more than happy with their quality. The Noah's Milk was my favorite! after sorting through the booze portion of the menu (which makes up about 90% of it - YAY!) we ordered some food to share for the table and we were happy with the prices (sandwichs were like 6-8 bucks) but THRILLED with the food! the pickle platter was great to pick and share with a group and the chicken liver sandwich is just awesome - i can no longer claim to not eat the stuff... It was a little hard to find on the street, but inside it was comfortably dark (i loved the bottle light fixtures hanging from the ceiling) and the music was perfect for the atmosphere (dylan, the clash - what more can you expect from a bar named after a Bukowski novel!) Two-thumbs WAY up! finally a place with good booze and food that I can afford in this city!"
1,-1,"Had a few beers, sat outside with my wife -- felt pressured to order food by an impatient server at a table unsuitable for more than a drink. Only cash! ??And there's an ATM machine inside! ??Very tacky indeed. Owner spent all this $ to fix up the place and won't except cards. Poor business plan and vision."
5,-1,"My favorite Sunday brunch spot in the east village. ??I am partial to the steak. ??The array of unusual juices delighted the non-drinker in me, however my raving alcoholic friends seemed quite content with the available booze. ??The decor and music are very chill. ??This place is made for a cool afternoon with your friends"
5,1,"Screw the pork. Seriously. The roast pork shoulder is delicious, and it's great for a party of 10 or more, but I'm telling you -- listen up -- if you don't mind losing a couple days of your lifespan to gastronomical delight, get a party of 4-6 and come here for the DUCK. The meat comes out still a little pink, mouthwateringly succulent, and the skin crispy and delicious on the outside! It's a little fatty, but that's the nature of duck. The dish comes with an assortment of greens and scallion pancakes and lettuce leaf wraps and rice, and several sauces to go with! It's duckin' amazing. I would come here every other week if it wouldn't break my bank account by Xmas. That said, it's actually not too expensive if you bring enough people to split; something like $140 (not including tax). Service is also very friendly, and make sure to make your reservation way in advance. Just thinking about this is making me hungry; I'll be back."
5,1,"Absolutely unrivaled steaks, wine and service in a cabin-chic atmosphere. When I say unrivaled, I mean unrivaled; St. Anselm's owners procure ingredients and wine ??vintages that no one else can (I've looked). Every consumable detail of this place has been considered at-length, much like its neighbor, Spuyten Duyvil (an amazing beer bar of the same ownership) but extending to jaw-dropping bone-in steaks and amazing micro vintage wines, all at prices that defy rationality in a completely positive way. The servers are as well-informed about the food and wine menus as the owners themselves. They're out to give you a good time and can't hide their enthusiasm when you're having one. I would seriously consider St. Anselm for my last meal on earth. You'll have to wait for a table. That's okay -- walk right next door to Spuyten Duyvil, get yourself a $15 beer brewed from the holy waters of the Ardennes mountains, sit in the back garden, and when the hostess from St. Anselm calls you for your table, bring your amazing beer into St. Anselm. And drink it. ?? Bottom line: if you love absurdly delicious steaks, wines that you'll gush over for weeks, and prices that defy explanation, eat here. You have nothing to worry about."
5,-1,"It still the best xlb in town, also the chili fried chicken is not bad. I love the pork knuckes ?? so full of flavors. The wait for us was about 15 minutes but well worth the wait on a friday night."
2,-1,burnt skewers of greasy meat. nothing like real japanese yakitori. good kirin draft. long wait. not worth it.
2,1,Pretty disappointed. Food was not spectacular (and I love fusion food). Place was too tiny even for an LES establishment. The saving grace was the ube waffle. . Other than that the place is a miss for me. Felt like there was much pretense and did not deliver. The bartender was not friendly at all. Place needs a Filipino charming bartender perhaps. Food was also overpriced for the portions given.
5,1,"The food never disappoints. Inna, Eldad, and the kitchen crew put so much effort and care into every dish, and you can definitely tell with each bite. The herbs omelette sandwich, shakshooka, warm kale salad (add chicken!), and schnitzel are my all time favorites. Can't go wrong with any of those."
5,1,"Hail bacon, full of taste. The flavor is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst pork products, and blessed is cut of thy meat, bacon. Holy Bacon, Master of Meats, pray for us eaters, now and at the hour of our fullness. Amen. Have you accepted bacon into your life? ??If you have or have not, you should go to BarBacon and enhance your personal relationship with bacon. ??I started with the bacon & beer flight. ??I had four kinds of bacon (two slices each) pair with four craft beers. ??Heavenly to say the least. ??I only slightly regretted getting it because upon closer examination I saw they also do a bacon & bourbon parings as well. ??I'm definitely getting that for next time. Then I proceeded to the BBQ Pork Sandwich. ??It was amazing. ??The smoked pork shoulder was tender and savory, the BBQ sauce was sweet and spicy and of course it had bacon on it. Everything has bacon on it. ??The group of people I were with, just ate up everything we ordered, and were shouting our praises and thanks to bacon for the delicious bounty before us. Don't think about it, just go."
4,1,"Walking up the steep steps to Yakitori Totto last night, I was taken back to Tokyo (where I have been a hundred times), but was comforted knowing that despite the steep steps I didn't need an earthquake escape plan in NY. ??Before we even ordered food, there was no doubt that Yakitori Totto was going an authentic experience. ??I was there with Japanese colleagues who just flew in from Tokyo. We were not disappointed with the food. We had a huge array of food, including chicken skin yakitori, pork neck, skirt steak, bacon and asparagus, eggplant w/ miso, their really fantastic Totto Soup, fresh gyoza, salad with cold chicken slices and more. ??The only misses were the Hotate (Scallop) yakitori, which was very thin and dry, and the fried octopus - it was not particularly flavorful or interesting. The only reason that I am giving this four stars is that it is really EXPENSIVE (although if you are a very light eater and don't drink you admittedly could get out for $25-30). ??I am not sure, but ""Yakitori Totto"" may translate to ""Expensive Sticks"". ??$300 for dinner for 4, and most of the people were light eaters - I certainly could have kept going. I will go back, but it will be for business dinners."
4,1,"I went there yesterday for a late dinner. We had the soft shell crab. It was definitely good, lots of meat in the crab whereas usually it is quite empty, very crispy on the outside and tender in the inside. But something was still missing for me and I cannot figure out what. Then I had the duck and foie gras ravioli. Excellent. It's not a big plate so if you are very hungry I would go for a scondi piatti versus one of the primi. This being said, it was delicious and unique. My friend had the short ribs and bone marrow agnolotti, which are little raviolis. It was also excellent and quite unique. My 3rd friend has the Black Tagliolini with seafood ragout & basil bread crumbs. That was excellent too and probably the best of the 3. We had a bottle of theBarolo Langhe Nebbiolo2010, it went very well with our dinner, I really liked it too. For desert, the warm rhubarbe tart came with a basil yogurt, macadamia nuts and a chianti sorbet... the chianti sorbet was excellent soft and not icy as some sorbets can be. The chianti sorbet and the rhubarbe tart worked very well together and the basil yogurt brought a hint of acidity and the nuts the crunch... perfection!"
4,1,We decided to try this out instead of waiting for stone park nearby. ??Similar to stone park there was a 90s hip hop vibe going but a little quieter. ??We sat at the bar immediately for our brunch. ??I had the Mexican egg sandwich which was smooth and tasty. ??I left the peepers off without thinking but I am sure that they would have been great. ??I also enjoyed the grannies bowl. ??The coffee was good as well but unlike most other places the portions were limited to the contents of a small french press. ??We expected the free refills but oh well. ??Will definitely go back as they were attentive and polite and clean
4,1,what is there not to like about freemans? the fact that it is off the beaten path and hard to find? the fact that the food is solid and the service impeccable? the fact that it is hard to get a table on the weekends? nothing. there is nothing to not like about freemans. from the mac n cheese to the lamb to the artichoke dip to the fries to the bananas foster.
1,-1,"I really had high hopes for this place because it looks nice and is near where I live but it was bad. It was loud, the staff were rude and pretentious (they make the drinks like they do in that bad Tom Cruise movie called Bartender) they played awfulmusic, it was overpriced, and worst of all, the food was bad. The burger was no different than the one you can get at In And Out Burger but three times and price. We also got the radish salad which was literaly seven whole radishes with sea salt sprinkled on them and one or two sprigs of watercress and it was $12 - I kid you not. Don't go here. waste of time and money."
3,1,"5 stars for the service and 3 for the food. The most memorable part was the service. Our waiter was attentive without being overbearing and very friendly. My group tried the Moussaka, Scallops and the Combination Platter. There were only 4 scallops on the plate. The funny thing is that the waiter told me that the scallops were REALLY big that night. Sigh. The Moussaka was good but a bit too heavy/creamy. I overheard my waiter telling the table next to me that the Moussaka was the best in NY. Hahaha. The best part was the Combination Platter. It was filling, delicious and flavorful."
4,1,"Wait for a table for two was an hour at 6:30 on a Saturday, but the hostess reconfigured the dining room and squeezed me and my mom in after a few minutes. First score of the night. Wine I got wasn't full-bodied enough for my taste -- I got the Carignan -- but I probably should have gone with my instincts and went with something further down the list instead of the middle. Mom and I split the pickles and they were awesome. So tasty, not too salty with a balance of sweetness. They need to jar them. We also got free popovers with honey, and split the squash tart, which was delish. I ordered the bean stew from the veggie menu, and it was very tasty, and just flavorful enough, and not loaded with salt. I strongarmed mom into splitting the bread pudding, which was delicious, but probably not a great idea since I was absolutely stuffed at the end of the meal, and then had to listen to a group of juvenile delinquents use the F-word in every sentence while talking about their court experiences on the shuttle bus that had replaced the F train. Anyway, if I could venture here despite MTA shenanigans, and be happy about it, then this place has something going for it."
4,-1,The only reason I a am not giving this place 5 stars is because of the wait. Always a long line to get in but well worth it! You should also note that they do not serve coffee anymore for this very reason. Food and service is always excellent.
4,1,"Reviews are based on two large takeout orders. Don't you love when you order and they give you 3-4 pairs of chopsticks when it's just for yourself? I like spicy but can handle tongue numbing spiciness is limited doses. Appetizers: - Wontons in chili oil. A classic dish. Very well made and flavored. Will order again. - Dry pepper chicken wings. It's a 9/10 on the spicy scale. You get a lot for the price, so better for a shared meal. It was ok. I won't be ordering this again unless I was with a big group. - Dan dan noodle. This is a classic dish and supposedly one of their most famous? I'm glad I ordered this over the cold sesame noodle. You get a hefty portion for takeout but make sure you mix it well! I would order this again. (June edit: These noodles taste amazing if you sear them on a hot pan to heat 'em up. Don't pour in too much liquid though.) - Chengdu Mung Bean Noodle. I love mung bean noodles. This was super spicy with the added flakes and oil. Too spicy for me without cleaning each noodle off. Def a good dish for sharing though. - Scallion pancake. I find it funny that it's listed under ""kids/baby adults"" on the takeout menu. It's a filler dish meaning it's good for a group, but it's not the best I've had. Entrees: - Three cup chicken. I love this dish. The chicken is in small bite size pieces and is slightly sweet. - Salt n pepper style shrimp. I prefer scallops but I doubt it would've been in the same quantity as shrimp. This is a dish better eaten hot. It loses its effect on the walk home and tasted slightly overcooked. - Shrimp or Taiwanese Sausage Fried Rice. It's not the best fried rice ever (My fave belongs to Rai Rai Ken), but it's pretty good and sizeable. However, the amount of sausage is pitiful. Once I added I think $4 for extra sausage and uhh I got the same or even less than normal amount. If you really like the Taiwanese sausage, splurge for the appetizer portion... Note: - Reservations are available for large parties only (I believe for 8-14 people for the round table in the back). - They don't always pick up their phone. It's probably because they're busy, so be persistent and call back. It's pretty annoying when I'm trying to place a pickup order and end up having to go there to place and wait for the order. - Delivery is available through trycaviar.com. They also have photos of the dishes they deliver on the website. Prices look different than HD's own menu and there is a $10 surcharge. I've never tried it. (June 2014 EDIT: I was sick and craving Han Dynasty. Ordered at 9:22PM on a Sunday. Got my order at 10. Everything was well packaged.) - Takeout orders typically take 20 minutes. - I've uploaded the takeout menu for those who prefer the Chinese/English translations. - They manage their tables and waitlist by iPad. If there's a wait, they take your number and call back. - There is bar seating. - Minimal room to wait inside."
4,-1,total favorite for puerto rican food - love going here for breakfast too. the staff is great - sometimes the food can be just a little bland though.
2,-1,Greek food with American twist.. Sounds good but tasted not so great :( The place is pleasantly decorated but we did not enjoy the food much.. I think they should stick with Greek recipes and not experiment too much!
5,1,"My friends and I hosted a baby shower brunch in the private party room on a Sunday. The manager, Gonzalo, was helpful every step of the way -experimenting with seating arrangements, helping with menu choices, and providing attentive service throughout our party. ??But that's not even the best thing about this place - the food is to die for. For a group of 35 women with very high standards, everyone ate every bite and raved about the food! I highly recommend the Huevos Banados (poached eggs, chili hollandaise, black beans, avocado) and slow-cooked heritage pork! It is a great little restaurant any day of the week, but if you're looking for a private party room with a great atmosphere, reasonable prices, delicious food, and attentive service, look no further - this place is a treasure."
4,-1,"This place is amazing, get the greek salad and roasted chicken, you cant go wrong. I live right near the place and go at least once every week or two. Its not cheap but well worth the price, i recommend it as a staple to the area, Greek food galore!!!"
5,1,"Sweet & Sara saved my Thanksgiving meal plan!!! I had done some research a few days before Thanksgiving to make sure I could find a marshmallow company that didn't have animal gelatin in their products because some of my guests were vegan. My boyfriend and I had attempted to make it at home but just couldn't get the mixture at the right temperature. When I called Sweet & Sara I didnt realize their factory was in Long Island City, not that far away from our apartment! I was so happy to visit their place with my roommate day before Thanksgiving. Sara literally saved our Thanksgiving sweet potato casserole I was trying to make! It was absolutely delicious and I would gladly buy from her again in the near future."
5,1,"I have eaten yakitori all over the city and this is definitely tops. Yes, they have a higher price point, but it's worth it - you can taste the TLC in the food. For example, while some restaurants grill their chicken hearts into mean, charred little hunks, Yakitori Totto always serves theirs tender and juicy. The same is true for the other yakitori. You can't go wrong with any of them, but the pork loin with mustard and/or the pork loin with scallion & ponzu are two of my favorites. A word to the wise. The restaurant is small so if you have a group and don't want to wait, make sure to call ahead. And they don't take same-day reservations."
5,1,"I love falafels and I love hummus, therefore when I walked by Crisp I knew it was my destiny to eat there. ??The place is really modern and clean looking and the menu is pretty simple and straight forward. ??I ordered the Mexican falafel sandwich (probably should have gotten it yesterday for Cinco de Mayo!) and it was super yummy! ??I will definitely be frequenting Crisp from now on."
4,-1,"One of the best things about NYC are the random unexpected neighborhood finds. This is one. My family of 3 checked out the window menu, were intrigued and enjoyed a nice, light Fri night meal. Particularly liked the chilled corn soup with creme fraiche and a special, fried green tomatoes. Comfortable, casual bar. Friendly service. Worth a stop!"
4,-1,"Cheeseballs aren't good for you, but you don't have to eat them. But you do, because you're hungry and they're free and you've been drinking highly affordable beer at the Levee."
5,1,"My co-workers and I come here fairly often for lunch, and I cannot wait to visit Juniper for dinner. ??It is truly one of our favorite spots, our dish of choice being the Steak and Cheese which is one of the best I've ever had. ??I walk away thinking about this thing all the time, and was pretty obsessed with it for quite some time. Almost all the dishes you'll find here will fall under comfort foods. ??And while I do wish there were a few more healthier options, you won't be disappointed with anything you get here. The portions are enormous and the fries (of all their different varieties) are quite addicting. ??Burgers are perfectly cooked and tasty. ??The fish dishes are soooo yummy and hugely sized. ?? ??If you're looking for a cheap lunch, the grilled cheese is a great deal and comes with Tom's super awesome french fries of your choice. ??The salads are enormous and delicious. ??The ribs are deboned and very tasty and the jambalya is generously flavored and portioned (though a bit too spicy for my tastes, I'm a wimp though). ??I love the Steak and Cheese so much that I hardly eat anything else here. There isn't a single disappointing thing on this menu. The prices are reasonable, and while a bit high for lunch is definitely good for dinner. Tom, the owner and chef, is one of the sweetest restaurant owners you'll ever meet and he never fails to come and greet us and chat with us upon our visits. ??He has done an excellent job making the restaurant feel quite homey in its personality. ??You will find not a trace of pretentiousness. ??It is simple in design, but you will certainly leave full and happy. ??The friendly waitstaff has always been very attentive to us. There is also a very lovely and spacious garden in the back. BYOB also helps make drinks here a cheap night out!"
3,1,"I love that this place is in my neighborhood. ??I have LOVED most of the food I've had. ??The ""system"" for ordering and receiving food really needs some attention from someone with good ideas. The service can be really great and friendly. ??It can also be SO unfriendly and awful that I think I might turn around and not go in if I see the one weirdly and aggressively and angrily unfriendly young ""lady"" working (the tall one with long hair and an inability to smile or be even courteous) --she was working saturday, april 20 in the early afternoon-- maybe something was wrong there that day because it was frowns all around, even looking into the kitchen. ??There was one exception: the young man with glasses working the register. ??He bumbled a little; it was busy and he seems new. ??BUT, he was actually friendly and didn't have the horrible attitude of the girl who was ""helping"" him. ??Everybody has a bad day/bad moment, but the many times I've been in there, she seems unable to muster ANY friendliness. ??Ugh. ??I'm SO over that attitude thing..."
5,-1,Very impressed with the Food and vast Ber selections. Everything I ate was very tasty and DELISH...I have found my place in Forest Hills. Steve the owner seems very with it and cares alot!!! That says alot in my book. See you guys this weekend!!!
1,1,"this was our go-to restaurant since opening. ??one that we avidly and loudly supported, recommended, forced upon anyone willing in the hopes that it could grab a foothold on a corner that changes every six months. unfortunately, we're finding a new go-to after today's botched visit. let's leave aside the fact that our party felt ill last week after our favorite lobster PLT sandwiches. ??hey, it happens. when i called in to reserve a table of 4 for brunch, i was told (unsurprisingly) they don't reserve brunch, but we'd be fine. ??no biggie, who reserves for brunch in hell's kitchen?we walk into an empty restaurant (which before today would have made me sad) and find that half of the empty tables have reserved signs on them-- and are given a table next to the 20 degree door. each of us asked the many employees nicely for the ""reserved"" table in the back, none of us got results. ??apparently, that 4 top in the back can seat 15 by the use of magic. alfie's, use your magical powers to treat your customers with respect-- especially when those customers are familiar faces that have brought you, literally, a couple grand in business over these winter months. ??by the looks of the joint at 12:30 today, you need the dollars. ??mine are going elsewhere."
3,1,"This place has high tables seating only. ??nice and cozy spot, but the food is only average. ??They have quite an extensive menu. ??i ordered a few of the montaditos and the conservas. ?? i would skip all the conservas - it pricey, small and not good at all. ??a few of the ??montaditos were decent. ??i had the smoked salmon, salt cured cod and the jamon & baby scallop. ??only liked teh smoked salmon and the jamon & baby scallop. ??the cod had no flavor what-so-ever. If i were to come back i'd try some of the other montaditos, ??that's assuming i come back - eh."
5,-1,I'm from Japan and I recommend this place. Yasuda Sushi is a well recognized and good sushi restaurant in Japan and they succeeded to bring the high quality sushi to the US. I used to eat there back home and I am very happy to eat the same good sushi here in NYC. They also have deli food and bento box that are not expensive and tasty. Only negative is that dine in can be crowded.
3,1,"We had an 8:30 pm reservation and the restaurant was packed. ??Nevertheless, we were seated immediately. ??The food was good, the service was efficient, but I left very disappointed. I guess my expectations were that this was a high-end restaurant with a great vibe given the fact I heard the concierge recommend it to another couple, Eater has it listed as one of 38 essential New York restaurants and Yelp gives it great reviews. ??I left feeling like I had just eaten at a high-end chain restaurant. ??The place just didn't have any real ambiance. ??This is a place I would stop in and eat if I was shopping nearby, not a place I would make a reservation or spend a special occasion."
5,1,"MAKE A RESERVATION. WEEKS IN ADVANCE. MAKE A RESERVATION. WEEKS IN ADVANCE. Of course, my friends didnt. -_______- So we get there and theres a ??""Free for all"" section where you can wait for a table. you could be waiting for 20 mins or an hour. it depends. The free for all section can be very tight and loud. Make sure your behind doesnt spill the next table meal or drink!! But whoa the FREE unlimited sangrias. YUM YUM YUM. i had like 9. my favorite is the Tropical and Harlem. I ordered some platter: eggs, homefries, spanish sausage, and soft tacos. the tacos were actually DRY. i didnt eat them anyway. but the food was def good. there food is very spanish style cuisine. This is not the typical brunch: waffles, french toast or pancakes. My friend ordered Rice & Bean W steak and eggs. yup thats 1 option. It actually tasted good. But ill be back. with RSVP this time."
3,-1,"The pizza here is overhyped and overpriced, as I expected it would be. I came on the recommendation of an ex who swore that this would be mind-blowing and better than my beloved Grimaldi's. Not the case. At all. I would not go out of my way to dine here again. However, if you do find yourself in the neighborhood, the atmosphere is quaint and would make for an ideal date setting. My friend and i agreed that the bathroom was probably the most interesting part of the entire establishment."
4,1,great broth. hip -- especially juxtaposed by the pull a ticket from a vending machine and eat at a counter in silence in a back alley in tokyo. on pricier side in terms of ramen as well.
4,1,Great Italian food sorta near Times Square/Broadway. Delish.
2,-1,"Honestly, this place was pretty disappointing. ??I had heard many good things about Tia Pol, and was excited to go, but the food was just Eh, and the wait was quite long. ??We had Sangria to start, which was pretty delicious, but after that it was all downhill. ??Highlights were the blue cheese croquettas, which were extremely miniature, but good. ??The bread with three sauce dish didn't make sense. ??The bread already had a garlic tomato sauce on it, so who wants to put another dip on top of that? ??In all, the food was nothing to write home about, and the portions were very little, even for tapas. ?? With that said, the place had a very nice ambiance and would have been great if we had been going for drinks and not dinner."
3,1,"I am wary of eating here after seeing a roach climbing around next to the wall I was sitting at. These creatures had no fear and it was disgusting....which brings me to health and hygiene. I think the employees here gave up on cleanliness a long time ago because it's always so busy. I also figure that since business is so good because the food here is good and cheap, that the likelihood of something sitting around long enough to be tainted is unlikely. I have not yet found an insect in my meal. However, I cannot speak for the utensils or the dishes or bowls the food is served in. The place is known for their breakfast, and rice dishes. However, it's gotten commercialized because of NYU students (I hate on these hipster kids cause once word gets to the NYU student body, they all huddle over like roaches and destroy what once was a harmonious system...They are my scapegoat for every reason...meegggghhhhh ??meeggghhhhh)."
5,-1,"I recently went to ABC kitchen for my birthday and it was fantastic. I had been looking up restaurants in the city for a while and came across it on a list of the top restaurants in NYC. I was a little apprehensive choosing a restaurant from this list, as I didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't live up to the hype. ??Well, it absolutely did! We had the ricotta apple dip, the raw scallops, and the roasted cauliflower for appetizers. All of them were amazing! The scallops were the perfect temperature, texture, and flavor. They had just the right amount of acidity. ??The cauliflower was out of this world. It had pieces of smoked bacon and and nuts that made the dish amazing. For entrees we had the meatball pasta, the chicken, and the crispy pork. All of them were awesome. i would recommend the pork and the chicken if I had to choose two. We had the caramel ice cream and the carrot cake for dessert. They were also great. The service was spectacular and the inside of the restaurant was absolutely beautiful."
4,1,"Great ramen! Better than Momofuku noodle bar. Get there soon, 6pm to get a table in 20 minutes, otherwise you'll have to wait 1h at least. The ambiance is cool, with all the staff greeting each costumer when they come in. I order the tripes for appetizer and the traditional ramen and loved it!"
4,-1,"We were searching for a brunch spot and found this place. Boy, is it small. Only about 15 tables so be prepared. Aside from that, the food was amazing. Candied slabs of bacon... Who knew?!? You may think you want to share, but trust me... you won't. French toast, Eggs Benedict, fresh fruit... soooo good."
5,-1,"This is my Favorite Indian food EVER (i haven't been to India yet, however). i've had at least 6 different entrees and keep calling back (i've only gotten takeout). the staff/owners are super nice and pleasant as well. do not hesitate to support and enjoy this treasure. P.S. they have changed their name to AGRA CLASSIC on their menus."
1,-1,"ok so the food was yummy and in front of me before I took my coat off... BUT WHY IN THE HECK DID IT TAKE 2 1/2 HOURS TO SEAT US!!! REALLY on a TUESDAY night at 8;30 I put my name on the list for 2 people and we sat at 11! really!! Then I was so hungry I ate in ten minutes and got out! Why couldn't everyone else do that. Why were they sitting at the tables talking?? What could they possibly have had to say that they didn't say while waiting for TWO HOURS!!! oh yeah, I'm hungry, let's eat, how is yours? mine is good... slurp, burp, let's get out of here! I must say as well, while waiting and watching the cooks, I saw them eat with their hands while cooking, blow their nose while cooking, why did I wait... hunger & hypothermia do strange things to you! I will go to Terakawa Ramen on 9th and 57th NEXT time I want Ramen. How hard can broth, noodles, pork and scallions be to throw together?! the wait staff was efficient...got to give them props.. they got is in and out"
4,-1,"OMFG. Is that allowed on yelp? Well, it needs to be, because that is what my taste buds said when I popped a frite doused in mango chutney into my mouth. The fries are humongous, and a large (to stay) can be too much for 2 people with medium appetites. The to go portions, oddly, are double the to stay portions. Don't know why. I don't really care. It's the sauces that are the important part. We also got the wasabi mayo, and the rosemary garlic mayo. They tasted like what we expected them to taste like. Enjoyable, but not mind-blowing like the mango. Can't wait to go back and try the pineapple one! Love the tables with the holes for the cones. Wish it wasn't as cramped so big groups could have a good time, but it's what you make of it. Get a to go portion and savor it in Tompkins Square Park as you watch the interesting folk of alphabet city go by!"
5,-1,"Love this place! ??Been eating here for years, and it never disappoints."
5,-1,"Was attending an event at the Javits Center and couldn't believe how poor the food choices are on-site. ??I decided to explore what was within walking distance. ??So glad I found Pio Pio 8 (thanks to Yelp)! ??What more can I say that hasn't already been said... great ambiance and decor, great food, and great sangria! ??Would definitely recommend the tuna ceviche."
5,-1,"Highly recommended! They have an indoor/ outdoor area, which is great for the summer. The service is always really good and the food is brought out fast. My absolute favorite meal to get is the burnt ends. They are so good they melt in your mouth. Pulled pork, sweet potatoes, and bacon baked beans are always favorites of mine. Another plus is this place is BYOB, so if you're on a budget, bring your own drinks and get the platter choice on the menu for around $30. This will allow you to choose the dishes and sides you love and share them with your friends/family. Love this place. Enjoy!"
5,1,"tl;dr version: We had a great meal but Alinea in Chicago still owns my heart. The reservation: 400 calls before getting someone on the phone. The week was already full and I was placed in the wait list. A spot opened and we took it. The process is pretty stressful and will be even more if you want a particular date or day of the week. The setting: half circle facing the kitchen. beautiful copper pans hanging. Chef Ramirez actually opened the door himself. Very nice and quiet decor. It is not a setting that invites conversation when in a party of 4 or more though. The staff: I've read many reviews complaining about the service and something must have happened since because I really enjoyed the service. Discreet, professional and knowledgeable. The server knew each course and their component by heart. Special mention to the sommelier who was very nice and knew her way around cheaper wines as well as more expensive ones. The food: The food was great. I'm not going to list all the dishes we were served because 1. I don't remember all of them and 2. the menu is changed almost daily. I had some minor issues with some of the dishes (a couple of them we over-seasoned and the sashimi preparation seemed quite acidic for my palate (but that may be a taste issue more than a flaw). Some dishes were amazing, such as the sea urchin with truffle, the flan with escargots or the desserts. But nothing totally blew my mind like I felt when we visited Alinea. No fireworks of flavor. just very clean and well presented dishes. What made me lean toward 5* instead of 4: Well, there is still not half grades in Yelp. I really appreciated the attention to the detail that chef Ramirez and his team put in each dish. Also, somehow, someone overheard that we were there for my fianc??e's birthday and they had a candle on her dessert plate. Will I go back? If someone makes the reservation for me, definitely."
5,-1,"Hands down the most creative and delicious sandwiches I have ever had! This is a family run business serving fine FINE fine ingredients on bread that is delivered fresh every day. I live in the area and see it delivered every morning! Everyone is friendly, yes sometimes there is a wait but it is worth it. I don't understand all the complaints about the size or cost of their sandwiches. This is a gourmet shop, if you people can't appreciate what Lamazou offers then go get your 5 dollar foot longs down the street. But if you want a quality and delicious gourmet sandwich there is no other place in the city or probably the entire east coast that offers this!!"
4,1,"Lovely Sunday brunch experience. Cozy country environment that makes you feel like you're back home at your family's farmhouse. There are even framed pictures of animals decorated throughout the restaurant. The food here was fresh with unique ingredients, however, my only complaint was the blandness of my omelette. I definitely had to salt and pepper my omelette quite a bit to get it up to taste. The potatoes and biscuits were satisfying and I also sampled my friend's sour milk pancakes which were delicious, light and fluffy. The service here was attentive. The food came out a bit slow, which I enjoyed as it was one of the first times I did not feel rushed at brunch. Surprisingly, for a table of 4, we arrived a few minutes before noon and only had to wait for about 15 minutes. Overall, I'd come back here again."
5,1,"Featuring a minimalist exterior of planked wood, the House of Small Wonder ironically stands out with its charmingly different sense of style. You're greeted by a tree upon stepping in, which seems to blend well with the rest of the decor, with the navy wallpaper, wooden tables, various potted plants, and framed ink-block prints along one the walls. The best things about this place is the ambiance and it's quiet and relaxing vibe. The people here are incredibly warm, and the breakfast prices here are very reasonable! I had a brie, pear, and fuji apple sandwich, a fruit salad, and a glass of OJ. No major complaints. This place is definitely worth a stop if you're in the area!"
4,1,"Food was very nice, coffee was SUPERB, service was outstanding. ??The mimosas and bloody mary's were great, too. ??All around, The Smith offered a lovely brunch."
5,-1,"My wife, friend, 12 year old, and I ate at Tink's Restaurant last night and all four of us loved the meal. I had an awesome Grouper Oscar with crab meat, it was lightly breaded and very tasty. My wife had Tuna, friend had snapper with a butter sauce, and 12 year old had a small Ceaser Salad, which was great, and fettuccine Alfredo and ate it all. Prices are a little high but in line for the quality and choices of food. I was able to take a taste of all 4 meals and all of them were outstanding. First time ever that we all agreed that our meals were great and we all would get the same thing again."
4,-1,"Solid French restaurant in Manhattan. The mussels and ribeye were fantastic. Also, the four 'as much as you want' vegetables were quite good. I really liked the couliflower puree. When dining here, remember that it is cash only and BYOB."
4,1,"I met up with my gal pals for brunch here earlier today and as expected, there was a whole mess of people hovering around waiting for a table. I was skeptical when the hostess told us the wait for 3 would be 30 minutes, especially on a gorgeous and sunny day such as today. There's definitely a pretty scene here and so the *eye candy* helps as you're waiting to be seated. To our pleasant surprise, we were seated in 30 minutes like the hostess had promised so don't let the crowd scare you away from trying Extra Virgin out. It is cramped inside and the tables are stacked on top of each other. We got a seat near the bar/kitchen area and so my chair was knocked quite frequently. Our server was polite minus 'tude which isin ??all I ask for. She was very good about refilling our waters and checked on us after our food came despite how mad busy she was. Two of us ordered the Banana French Toast w/maple syrup and the other person ordered a Shrimp Cobb Salad. The Banana French Toast portion is big and the French toast is thick. It was actually quite delicious without being overly sweet. It also had toasted bananas in there with a spoon of whip cream. The Shrimp Cobb Salad was meh and looked quite dry due to lack of dressing. Overall, I enjoyed my Banana French Toast and don't mind coming back but only if the wait time isn't too ridiculous."
2,1,Gets the job done.
5,-1,Love the octopus appetizer (forget the name ) caesar salad with black salt ??and the Polenta with prosciutto and mozzarella... The restaurant is so cozy and very old school.. I usually order delivery from here once every other week and everything is always great!
5,1,"$5 Brunch Drinks ??were awesome. Great variety! I tried the sangria one and the tequila one. Sorry I should have wrote down names Fave dishes: Fried Chicken, BBQ Shrimp w. Crispy Grits and Butterbeans! Notable mentions: Fried Green Tomatoes and Collards Will be bringing my friends to try this place."
4,1,"Delicious, reasonably priced and close to work, this place is definitely one of my favorites."
4,1,"These aren't the best noodles that I've ever had, but they're close enough and darn cheap as well. A friend and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night after discovering that the wait at Joe's Shanghai around the corner was too long. This place is pretty run-down and can only seat 20-30 people, but I never saw anybody have to wait for a table. We ordered the beef noodle soup and the house special noodle soup both with knife-cut noodles. The only difference was the addition of tripe, ox tail, tendon, and a fried egg in the house special. I didn't like the beef that they used - most places use a thick and tender cut of beef for their beef noodle soups, but these noodles had thin, chewy slices (I think it was brisket?) that weren't tender at all. I did love the huge plastic containers filled with cilantro on each table so that you can add however much cilantro you want to your noodles. I probably dumped half of the container into my bowl. Both my friend and I had way too many noodles in our bowls and didn't get anywhere close to finishing them. The total came out to $15 after tax and tip. Where else in Manhattan can you get two bowls overflowing with delicious noodles for $15?! Chinatown never ceases to amaze me. As with many places in Chinatown, this place is CASH ONLY!"
5,1,"Great deviled eggs, fresh oysters. Spicy garlic shrimp is excellent. Also get the root beer float and don't substitute it with coke, because they have special root beer. :-)"
4,1,"super cute and intimate love the window view in the back portions are small ... - monkey bread - buttery and savory - egg - which is boneless chicken wings, potato, artichoke and poached? egg - bucatini - has a kick =) - sucking pig - kind of reminds me a lil bit of like just roast crispy pork, comes with two sauces bonus points - brought a friend here for bday and they wrote 'happy birthday name' on the menu ... uber cute touch!!! (came here at the end of april)"
4,1,"Met up with Sandy C. (Queens) on a Sunday Evening and her BF. Thanks To Groupon, we decided to try this place out. I'm a big Venezuelan Food person (that's where I'm from) and it was pretty hard to get really good ""AREPA"" in NYC. ??Now, it's everywhere!. Very friendly staff, but a bit slow on service. ??Owner of the Place stopped by in every table to greet and make sure everything was ok. Menu is very simple and pretty good selection of Arepas stuffed with different types of meat, veggies. ??Also they have couple of Entrees listed that offers steak, pabellones. We decided to try out some appetizers and arepas (that's what we came for). Appetizers: Mini Cachapas Mini Empanadas (Chicken, Beef, Mini Shark) ?? ??(o_O) Entree Sandy C - Bomba Arepa (Reina with Sliced Avocado and Guayanese Cheese) Her BF - Carne Mechada Arepa (Shredded Beef) Me - Arepa de Catira (Shredded Chicken with melted Cheese) The way they make this arepa are different than Caracas and Patacon. ??They use a grill / bake the arepa instead of frying them. ??less crispy and you can taste the juicy meat. ??They stuff a lot of meat and the cornbread is pretty thin. ************************ ?? ?? ?? ??WARNING ?? ?? ?? ***************************** Before you eat an arepa, make sure you hold the arepa with TWO HANDS and the plate should be under the arepa to pick up your messy juice dripping it. ??SPECIALLY ??anything that has Beef in it. it's super J.U.I.C.Y.! DO NOT MAKE A MESS on your SHIRT! Mini Empanadas are descent, it was one of those baked empanadas which was O.k. Mini Cachapas with cheese and option to add sour cream. ??It was ok too, light and blend. Dessert: Tried Tres leches - It was very moist and not sweet at all (which I LIKE!). ??Thick layer of whipped cream. ??I recommend to share that with your friends because my tummy was about to blow up after I ate half of the piece. Price was descent, cheaper than Caracas arepa bar but not as Stuffy as Patacon. ??Thanks to Groupon we saved couple of bucks!."
4,-1,Delicious beef noodles and BBQ pork. Very inexpensive too.
3,1,"Stopped in for a few drinks after the Chili Cook Off at Hudson Terrace. ??It is a true pub, clean beer taps pour a great, chilled pint, great selection of beers and moderately priced wine by the glass. There was a private party happening in the back and it was crowded, but my thought is that this place is always crowded, with regulars, west siders and loyal clients that know the bartenders and the owner. ??It feels like a family place and I dig that. ??Quick, friendly service and it doesn't smell like an old man's bar. ??Much appreciated......."
4,-1,"We were recommended by the Intercontinental Hotel so I decided to give it a try. Their menu is simple. Fettuccine salmon were cooked al dente. My husband got chicken piccata and he loves every piece of it. One tip: I request to be seated in one of the corner booth, you will have a full view of this tiny place. Service was very pleasant as well."
5,1,"The best grilled chicken I've ever had!! Ordered the 1/2 chicken. Definitely enough for two people, but I ate it all myself. Tender, moist, juicy, and full of flavor. Lots of meat and boneless (thanks Purbird). Had the house salad on the side--perfect veggies and a just-right vinaigrette, simple and tasty. I hope this place sticks around for a long time. It's hard to find succulent grilled chicken anywhere, let alone one that is organic and hormone-free. Also, very friendly kitchen staff and owner. So glad they're in the neighborhood."
3,1,"The view was beautiful, the wait staff very entertaining, the bus boys are very attentive but the food just didn't match the other elements. ??The wait for the food was way too long. ??Once the food got to us, it was hot but bland. ??I'm hoping this place is a work in progress since they are a new establishment."
1,-1,"one of the worst dining experiences I have ever encountered. My friend and I were there today. We were the first people in the restaurant and the LAST to be served. Instead we watched a party of 2 and a party of 6 that arrived after us receive their meals first (making it worse, the party of 6 was all white women, so i guess they really didn't want to make them wait) I was utterly disgusted and couldn't believe what I was seeing. I will never eat a Peaches or Smoke Joint or any other related establishments again. I would never recommend to anyone, as much as I'd like to try and support I can't. Absolutely unacceptable and disgusting customer service."
4,1,"I love this new little place. ??Yesterday was my 3rd visit and it seems different/ better smoother somehow not such a long wait between courses and it was pretty full last night. I stil don't get the name and honestly when I first heard it I thought...""what does that mean do they put sugar in every dish?"" Thankfully that does not appear to be the case. We had the crawfish balls ( texture temperature look sauce was all very good) but the crawfish was rubbery ??distracting but the flavors were good. the fried chicken was great the muffalata great authentic... the po boys... the bread was a little thick hard to chew through, wanted a soft bun like a hot dog bun to hold that fried goodness and dressing. I heard they will be opening 7 days soon and also feature a brunch menu. ??exciting we need a great brunch place. I hope they add a couple of salads so I can eat there and justify ordering the mac and cheese which is really good. looking forward to going back."
2,1,"I started with a Bloody Mary super hot (I didn't order a Voodo - just asked for a Bloody Mary) and tasted of Old Bay seasoning for some reason. ??Good beer selection, switched after being fried by the Bloody Mary. ??Good oysters, had a couple different types. ??Will not order the ??beef Poboy, sloppy and fairly tasteless, hard to eat as a sandwich, maybe it was tasteless after the super over the top ""taste"" of the Bloody Mary? ?? I'll try something else next time, I'll be back. Service was good."
4,1,"Sandwiches are delicious. The bread is fresh and has that ""crunch"" which just makes the filling even more tasty. I had the lemongrass chicken and it had great flavor/very moist chicken. The frozen iced mocha is great too. This was my first sandwich from Joju, but definitely not my last!"
5,1,best salty flavorful broth.
5,-1,"This place is a solid 5 star joint. I have NEVER been anything but absolutely thrilled after every single meal I've had at the Spy. It's a bit pricy , but it's always worth it."
5,-1,"I had the unexpected delight of eating here a few weeks ago. An upscale neighborhood joint, Tavern on Jane strikes the perfect balance of cozy neighborhood spot (I heard the waitstaff refer to many of the diners by name) yet has really good comfort food -- at a decent price. Hard to find in this neighborhood that is pretty trendy (and great for people watching!) -- the lunch specials are a steal at only $12 (including soup or salad). I was here for dinner, and I have to say that the fried oysters (with ??crispy cornmeal battering) are amazing -- better than most I've had in the south. The burger was really, really good, with perfectly crispy fries and a side of coleslaw and pickles -without cheese it's $12 -- and is a full, delicious, meal. I'll definitly be back. Staff was really friendly, atmosphere was cozy and comfortable (they have a fireplace and brick walls, with candles on tables at night), and from there I spent the rest of the evening walking around the West Village -- a great way to walk off those yummy fries. :-)"
3,1,"love the simplicity & the fries holders if you get a craving for French fries European style & you don't mind the smell of frying this is a nice place to drop by, but keep in mind its really tight ?? souse is the HOT one, the pesto is not bad too"
5,-1,"Simply delicious. ??I haven't had their calzones yet, but I definitely want to go back to try them out! ??The pizza is not even comparable to other, standard pizzaria-types; it's like comparing a home-grilled, juicy burger straight from the farm to a processed sandwich off the Dollar Menu. ??Like I said, simply delicious!"
5,1,"A week later I am still drooling over my French Fries. I think these french fries were the most memorable item from the restaurant granted I did not have one of the egg dishes! There was something intoxicating about the french fries. My bar steak was cooked perfectly as ordered. The service was wonderful. They were attentive and gracious. The wait was a little long, an hour on a Saturday afternoon, but expected. I will definitely come back here my next trip to NYC!"
5,1,"We were looking for a bite to eat before heading to a show nearby but were restricted with time. It didn't look like there was a wait, so we walked in for dinner. I'm so thankful we did. I have no idea why this place was not busier. The food was AMAZING. I had the skirt steak with vegetables on the side and my mouth is still watering just thinking about it. It was cooked to perfection and the sauce on the side was delicious. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend stopping in here. For the quality of the food, I'm surprised it wasn't more expensive."
5,1,"Honestly one of the best Italian restaurants I ever went to. Every time I go there I feel very welcome, as the staff is very friendly and make me feel like I am talking to a friend rather than a waiter. The service is great, with the staff providing you everything you need. The food is absolutely amazing, Ancora has the best pasta dishes I have ever tasted. I have been to Ancora numerous times and having tried something new every time, I was never disappointing... everything is great. The new location at The Double Tree Hotel is wonderful, just across the street from its original location which is not at all an inconvenience. I love the new place and I am sure I will be coming back for the superb food and service."
4,1,the only bad part of this experience was that it had to come to an end. i agree with David ??L's review completely and as i started desperately scavanging for the last remaining noodles at the bottom of my bowl - i actually felt sad that my meal was coming to an end. i can't wait to go back.
5,-1,"oh boy, oh boy have i been waiting to write a review for this place forever! and i am cramped on time but i promise to update this eventually. north spy food is hands down my fave breakfast/brunch spot in the entire city. i cosider myself a foodie, big time, i am a food blogger, editor and all around enthusiastic eater and this has got to be the poster child of great local/seasonal dining places in manhattan. a close runner up list is ABC kitchen, egg in brooklyn, and stanton social...if you're interested in my tastes!"
2,-1,"Got delivery, I imagine the in-house dining experience is different. ??Food was maybe not quite as good as the other thai delivery places I have tried in the area and the delivery took maybe 3 times as long as the other places. Maybe they are just having a bad night...."
4,1,"This is a cool little Medi/French bistro tucked away just off of Prince Street. ??It's great on a lazy afternoon, especially in the spring when the doors are open, people are sitting out front and walking by. ??Although the service is a bit inconsistent, the food is excellent. I love the retro Parisian atmosphere."
5,1,"What an amazing place. Solid atmosphere, fantastic bartenders - and in a neighborhood i hadn't ever stepped foot in. There are a string of bars on this block - so you can bar hop if for some God-unknown reason you don't happen to fall in love with the Ear Inn."
3,-1,"I have been going to Pio Pio (138st and Cypress, Mott Haven) since it opened a little while back. Its a nice place..good food...and a GREAT addition to the neighborhood. However, when you enter this trendy restaurant, you are greeted by a thug at the door, with the hat turned backwards, 10x too big jeans hanging 2 feet below his waist, gigantic oversized shirt, tattoos, and ridiculously huge Timberlands. It struck me as very odd why they would choose to have this as the first impression, and as the seating host of the restaurant, when everything else is so nice, trendy, etc. I was GREATLY DISSAPPOINTED AND DISGUSTED to learn why this thug is the one greeting you at the door. Pio Pio is paying off the local gang for some absurd reason, and this thug is the ""security"" for the restuarant. Basically they feel the need, for some reason, to have gangmembers running their business...much like the supposed ""protection"" that the mob offered all those years ago. Not only will I NEVER go there again...I am shocked that they are suporting the local thugs and will be sure to make everyone aware of what is going on. I recommend everyone reading this to not only boycott the chain but to expose the restuarant for supporting/encouraging local thugs/gangs!"
4,1,"After a performance show at Lincoln Center, my friend and I decided to find a nice tapas bar to drink and have a few small bites just before we head to a party.. We couldn't find this place because it was small and kinda hidden?? it was dark and we thought the place is close. By looking in, you can see that it was slightly crowded at the bar where people enjoying some wine.. It was also kinda loud.. We got ourselves a table, order a glass of wine each and the octopus and the chocolate dessert.. The octopus is delicious.. It's so perfect to enjoy it as a small appetizer.. It was savory but not over, cooked with some sweet spices but I don't remember.. Perfect to enjoy with the bread.. The chocolate dessert wasn't as great.. it was still good but I think the texture was too hard.. Overall, it's still a nice place in the Hells Kitchen area.. only thing it they close at midnight."
3,1,"Another tiny little place in chinatown. I prefer ""La Mian"" to any other kinds of noodle. It is ""La Mian"" and is different from ""Lai Mein"" or ""Lao Mein"" or any other Cantonese noodle. It comes from north west China. The food there is good. i like the noodles best. But their portion and meat are just so so. Another important thing they need is some troditional ""Shan Xi"" sesame oil. Everytime I think of ""La Mian"", I miss Beijing so much."
5,1,"I'm torn. ??Why does this have to be so good, yet so far away? ??Impossible love. Famous Original was as close to my perfection as it might get. ?? It's simple, thin, has a crunch in the crust, and a bite in the cheese. It was actually one of those things where I thought it was awesome while eating it, and now I just feel like there's a void in my life. I may or may not be writing this in my bed, 24 hours after the fact and 3000 miles away. We'll always have that day, Bertie."
2,-1,"Unfortunately, there were a good number of quirks in our service and meal that kept this from being a good experience. First of all, we made a reservation, but were still asked to wait for 15 minutes. I understand that overbooking happens from time to time, but it's still annoying. More to the point, our food matched the generally disorganized service: it was definitely a rushed and messy ordeal. We had to send one plate back because the dish had not been washed properly. Ick! The ravioli was okay, but kind of heavy and it somehow had not been cooked evenly. The pizza was nothing special, though certainly not bad. We were gonna stick around for dessert but decided not to chance it and headed out. One thing's for certain, if you decide to bail on Emporio, there are plenty of other great places in LIttle Italy to check out!"
5,-1,"Excellent pizza. I'm not usually a white pizza eater and this white pizza was good enough to make me consider it more often. Good beer selection too. Wesley was the best server we had in NYC, great job!"
5,1,"I appreciate the vast array of foods among the five boroughs of New York City. At the end of the day, however, it's the home-down, diner-style, well-cooked foods that are the best. No flamboyancy. No ostentatious ingredients. No $15 dollar cocktails the size of the thimble. Screw all of that. Just a counter that fits a dozen people, hot trays of food behind it, whip-fast honest service, and the basic elements of a good homey meal. You can get a good meal with Ukrainian / Eastern European roots here, with pretty much nothing on the menu exceeding $12. Nightly specials of beef stroganoff and breaded fish filets served on huge plates with mashed potatoes and veggies look mouth watering, and the choice between the type of pierogis and soups to buy is a challenge, as you want to have them all...NOW. I am happy with my choice of meal: Four freshly-boiled and toothsome potato pierogis smothered in caramelized onions, a cup of rich and flavorful split pea soup, two slices of dense Challah-like bread smothered in creamy butter, and a bowl of apple sauce. I enjoyed every single bite immensely and felt genuine sadness when I realized it was all gone. And did I pay $8.05 for all of that, which left me completely and pleasantly full? YES. Yes, I did. No offense to Per Se and its Slow Baked Garnet Yam Veloute with honey poached cranberries, toasted pecans, sage and black winter truffle...BUT. In a city full of gaudy food choices, some needlessly so, Stage Restaurant provides you with a good, honest, filling, and satiating meal. You'd be hard pressed to find anything close to this anywhere else."
4,1,"I dine here once every week after work. The roasted chicken with the couscous is phenomenal, that is all you need to know. Great jazz band, great bartenders, great service, great food over all. I actually met Hip-Hop Artist/Actor ""Common"" here one night, pretty cool guy. Made the night even better. Cheers."
4,-1,"My favorite tapas place in any city! ??Comfortable and cozy atmosphere. ??All of the food I've tried was delicious and unique. ??My favorite, oddly enough, were the roasted brussel sprouts. ??Held off going back this year due to the hepatitis breakout, but will soon go back. ??I'm a health nut and sad to see one of my favorite restaurants in the city go through that negative press. ??Hidden gem!"
5,1,"The falafel here is cheap, delicious, and always fresh. ??Sometimes the line is long, but it is always worth the wait."
5,-1,Still the best Greek place in Astoria!!!
3,1,"It's a fun, cute place but always felt something' missing or lacking.. love their chicken & mixed drinks but some things on their menu could definatly improve!"
4,-1,"Went solo for lunch, so sat at the bar. Their lunch special is fantastic value so gave that a whirl. Started with their famous pork buns. Three months later, I still think about those amazing pillow like buns surrounding the sweet, rich salty pork belly that gave me a heart attack just looking at it. So good. Main was a very passable lamb dish. The details escape me, but it looked good enough for the celeb sitting next to me (you know, the brother from My Name Is Earl) to look over and ask what it was. He was living vicariously though my meal as he just had a plate of pickles for lunch (""I can't eat meat - what would you recommend?""). I mean, seriously, pickles!!? Dessert actually blew me away. The apricot sorbet and thyme mousse was a total surprise. The presentation reminded me of wd-50, but the flavour was truly unique. Bravo."
4,-1,"Thoroughly enjoyable meal from start to finish. A small place with a back yard area as well. The menu is limited with a few specials but varied enough to cover most tastes. Our server was very pleasant and helpful in describing the dishes and in letting my friend taste her wine choice before ordering. We shared the beets and mandarin oranges app and the roasted cauliflower app , both were delicious and ample enough to share. For our main we split the pork chop which was a nice thick cut and moist throughout. It came with a side semolina panelle a sort of quiche/polenta ??type dish. They also served a small homemade bread that was amazingly good and light. While some have written of the portions being small we didnt find that to be the case. The apps while not enormous were more than enough for two and its not just about quantity its about quality and taste which was definitely there. Same for the chop that we easily shared. It was filling enough that neither of us ordered desert as we were nicely full. We were there early so no crowds not sure how it is latter in the evening but they take reservations. Now on my list of places to return to."
5,-1,"Awesome food, great bartender, relaxed and fun atmosphere. Will definitely be back"
4,1,"got here right when it opened, and had absolutely no wait on a weekday during christmas week. the akamaru modern ramen is to die for. i will dream of the hot steaming broth, the chewy noodles and the slices of pork belly -- 95% fat, 5& meat -- for weeks and months to come. the pork buns were delicious and pleasantly spicy; my only wish is that they come 4 to a plate instead of just two for $7. me wantee pork buns!"
5,1,"Pretty tiny shop with excellent goods. ??Good coffee and Ceci-Cela chocolate croissants and Balthazar almond croissant... No need to go to Soho anymore. ?? Also the best toasted/buttered bagel I have ever come close to having downtown. This place is a huge plus for the FiDi area. ??Only problem - it is right next door so I will probably gain 10 pounds from the place. Friendly staff, not a long wait... Take a visit here.. You won't be disappointed. ?? There are a lot less of us working downtown here now ??- those of us left need to support the downtown businesses!"
4,1,"[Let me start off with a negative comment] After we walked in, we proceeded to stand in the dining room for about 3 minutes before the front of the house, who was looking directly at us, decided to walk over and seat us. That was a bit of rather lackluster service. The service improved tremendously after we were seated; our waiter was lovely. The aforementioned 3 minutes aside, we had an excellent dining experience during Dine-Out Brooklyn week (I know, I'm falling way behind on timely reviews). The homemade bread, whipped butter, and lentil p??t?? were incredible. OMG, THE DIVER SCALLOPS WITH SUNCHOKE PUREE was one of the best dishes I've ever had. Our entrees were very good as well. I believe I had the duck cassoulet which was hearty and perfect on a cold winter evening. The dessert wasn't a stand out, but the savory courses (+ the warm atmosphere!) were enough to make me wish I could eat at Applewood a few times a week."
4,1,"I've died and gone to truffle! ??2 dishes I always keep coming back for - Mushroom Crusted Chicken with Truffle broth and the Truffle Mac and Cheese Tart. ??cute, cozy, date, dinner with the girls type of place."
4,1,"I came across this place on my way to the NYU Skirball Center for a friend's fashion show. The words ""Crepes To Go"" immediately drew my attention.. haha. I haven't tried eating inside the restaurant but I've been to the take-out window right next to it, twice already and I'm planning to go back soon and try more combinations! They have dessert and savory crepes!! I love that they have soo many ingredients to choose from. A variety of cheeses, meats (bacon ftw!), chocolate, fruit, whipped cream, nuts, you name it - they most likely have it! They make it right in front of you on a heating plate (?) so you can see the entire cooking process. You get a choice of 3 things to put inside the crepe :) I've tried both dessert and savory crepes. My first time, I shared a Swiss Cheese, Onion, and Mushroom crepe with a friend in Washington Sq Park. It was SO good!! I wanted to eat the whole thing but it was just too big and filling. They give you the right amount of ingredients so that the crepe isn't overflowing but you're also not wishing for more. My second time, I shared a Banana, Nutella, and Hazelnut crepe with another friend in Washington Sq Park (since its so close to this place). MAN OH MAN. This was even better than the savory one. I think crepes are better off in dessert form, but I'm still feening to try a breakfast crepe from them with ham, eggs and cheese! The prices are worth it because the crepes from here are pretty darn good and really quickly made! The service can be kinda annoying sometimes bc the people who make it are mexican and have a hard time calculating change in their heads and speaking good english (not being racist here, it's the truth!) Overall, I will definitely be back for more crepes when I'm in the area again! Final Verdict? 4 stars ****"
5,-1,"Great addition to the neighborhood. Fried chicken is delicious. Good sides -- they have mashed potatoes, which for some reason is kind of rare these days at places with sides. There's a nice spin on basics here -- love the hot vinegar sauce that comes with the fried chicken. The kale, spiced up nicely with pickled peppers, wasn't boring. Everything is reasonably priced. I just hope they stick around. Nice bar too."
5,-1,"Still a favorite. ??attractive space. great location and authentic, consistently good bistro food. ??the skate is exceptional. Even its unfortunate inclusion in guide books, which brings the tourists and BBQs, has not diminished the place in my mind"
4,-1,We celebrated my cousin's 24th birthday at this cozy little restaurant last night and everyone enjoyed the meal -- from appetizers (recommend the spicy lemon shrimp) to the last bite of our guinness dark chocolate cake!
5,-1,"Oyster bloody mary...need I say more?? ??All of the seafood is good. ??French onion soup. ??Burger. ??Bar steak. ??I dream of you duck confit. ??This place has been around for a while, but I still think the scene is really good. ??Maybe even better now as it's more mellow than scene-y, if you know what I mean. Minor complaint - you will probably wait a bit for your table, even with a reservation. ??normally I am happy to wait with a drink at the bar, but last time I was there the bar was packed and only one bartender! ??I don't think that's typical though. ?? If you can ever make it here for breakfast, do it. ??Excellent french toast and breadbasket."
4,-1,"I'd give this restaurant 4.25 ??We came for New Year's Day Brunch, which was great because the restaurant had a comfortable number of patrons, but wasn't too busy. ??We took our time and didn't feel rushed. ??My guests were each discerning Greeks, who prioritize the quality of the food they eat as among the most important aspects of everyday life. ??The feedback was consistent: great quality for Astoria, unique meals, and amazing octopus (probably the best item on the menu). ??The hangar steak and bulgur salad (latter not on the brunch menu but we asked for it, and we were happily accommodated) got high marks as well. ??Great wine, cocktails, sangria and craft beer menu. ??Finally on the positives, ambiance was terrific. Go with a bigger group if you can. One negative was that we all agreed the food needed less salt. ??We felt the effects afterwards and needed a lot of water. ??This prevents us from coming often due to general health consciousness, but if this changed, MP would probably be our go to Astoria spot. Another negative was the dumpling dish. Dumplings are a uniquely shared dish in cultures across Asia and Europe. Greeks have their versions in dolmadakia and lahanodolmades, and those Greeks from Asia Minor or near strong Turkish influence made manti, which is more of a meat filled dough dumpling. ??Some unique twist to these common and delicious dishes, with strong flavor characteristics would have been awesome. I couldn't understand the mish mash of ingredients in this dish to the point that I couldn't finish it. Overall, nice place. Hope the evolution from here is positive and am looking forward to returning."
4,1,"On one of the first truly chilly nights of the winter, a friend suggested we meet at Almond for a bite. This is a place I've passed by every day on my way to and from work, but never felt compelled to walk in the door. I'm glad I did! The exterior presents a certain bland vibe that I'm pleased to say did not persist. We sat at the long bar by the wood-burning fire, though the space is huge and had we wanted a table there would have been no wait. The service was friendly and casual, there when you needed but not pushy. We ordered a couple starters and sides to share... the house-smoked bluefish appetizer was a hefty portion: a light and crispy potato latke topped with thick slabs of savory smoked fish, the plate was brushed with an understated yogurt sauce that paired perfectly. The charred squid was next, also big enough to be a main course, and took the consistency of a loosely chopped salad with avocado, sliced potato, charred rounds of squid and some salty sea beans -- accompanied by a mysterious, spicy red compote and a rich tangy mayo-based sauce. It was tasty, enjoyed thoroughly by my friend as I'm not a huge fan of squid that's not friend up into crispy calamari. We indulged in two sides as well: the roasted brussel sprouts with pancetta & candied walnuts were perfect, over-done so as to bring out the sweet and flaky leaves, all drizzled with lemon to brighten. Finally, the macaroni came out still boiling in a ceramic dish (the best way to receive any dish) - it had a wonderful blend of cheeses not too rich or salty, not too sharp, and just the right amount to deliciously douse the al dente penne. Reluctantly, I allowed my friend to take home the left-overs..."
3,-1,"So I debated about whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars, and finally leaned towards 3. ??I dined here with five girlfriends for brunch one lazy Sunday morning. ??It's located on ""trendy"" 10th Ave. in Chelsea, lots of indoor and outdoor seating. ??The atmosphere is definitely four stars, the inside is airy, open and bright. ?? The brunch menu has a southern flare - with beans, grits, and biscutts coming with several egg dishes. ??The menu is a bit overpriced ($12-$17 for most brunch options) and at least $10 per drink. ??We waited AWHILE for our food. ??Also, the cream for our coffee was curdled. ??The waitstaff replaced it, but it was gross. ?? Everyone was satisfied with the food (the Cookshop scramble was yummy - nothing wrong with bacon, eggs, and a biscutt all scrambled together). ??We were a bit sticker shocked when the bill came (with an added 20% for service). ??All in all I liked Cookshop, but it was too pricey for my taste."
3,1,"I had great expectations from the other Yelp reviews, but I was disappointed. The place is large and with a nice decor, and the pizzas are very large. ??But I found the pizza just OK, and quite pricey (my ""small"" No. 4 with arugula and prosciutto was $24 at lunch time). The revealing sign: I left half of my pizza and they packed it for take away. I forgot it on the table, and I NEVER forget left over food..."
4,-1,Love it here. Clean fresh. And great service. Will come back. It's very romantic. Came here on a date the first time. Now with my BFF.
2,1,So strange .. The food was bad ... Quality was bad .. Prepared ..bad ... It was just disgusting really. I feel horrible really bc the service was amazing . They were so sweet.. To the point where I couldn't tell them the food made me nauseous... The wine was cheap..so much so that I didn't finish it !! (Which is wild). I had the pappardelle and oxtail- tasted like cheapp noodles with canned beef soup... My friend had the veal meat balls with penne.. - tasted like tomato paste and turkey meatballs... And there was this powdery grit to it .... I ordered chianti... Tasted like warm pomegranate juice ... Before we even sat.. And before we were given the menu.. He offered bread and oilives.... ?? Of course we obliged....somehow I find it strange that it was on the bill.... Yelp you've failed me here...
3,1,"I went to dinner with a group of 5 to Calle Ocho on a Monday night. ??The have a nice big dining room in the back and it didn't feel overly crowded at all. There was music, but not so loud that we couldn't hear each other. ??The food was very good, but I didn't find it as memorable as at other restaurants. And for some reason it took a very long time for our food to be served. ??Other than that, the service was great. ??I had a watermelon mojito, which definitely left something to be desired. ??It was way too sweet and tasted like a Jolly Rancher's. ??There was hardly any alcohol in it. ??My friends had the regular mojito, which they said was good, but a little weak. My friend asked the waiter to add more alcohol. ??All in all, it was a good place for a group, but nothing to write home about."

2,1,"After watching a Food Network special on pastrami and other deli meats, a friend and I were on a mission to hunt down that most elusive of prey: the tastiest deli sandwich we could sink our teeth into. Unfortunately, it was nowhere to be found at Junior's. We decided to come here after watching Avenue Q (which was pretty hilarious - sort of like Sesame Street on meth) since it was just down the street. ??I was fixin' for a mean sandwich, as were we all. I ordered the ""Something Else"", which actually did sound like something else - brisket piled on top of potato pancakes. ??Sounds pretty good, right? ??NO. ??When I had my first bite I could not help but yell ""DO NOT WANT."" ??The brisket tasted like they had recovered it from the trash heap two days ago. ??The potato pancakes were just alright, but nothing to write home about. ??If it weren't for the outrageous price ($16?) then I could understand, but the value just was not there. Both my friend and my fiancee ordered the pastrami. ??It looked okay, but they said the pastrami was better at the Ritz Diner, down the street from our place. ??According to them, the pastrami was piled higher at Junior's, but the amount of cheese and sauerkraut was underwhelming. ??As a red-blooded American male, I usually enjoy huge helpings of delicious, spicy, meaty pastrami. ??But pastrami is something you just can't f*ck wit, so if it sucks, give me some more cheese and sauerkraut to cover it up. Service was pretty abysmal. ??Sure, it was busy, but I've been to even busier establishments where the servers worked hard to get us refills and any other requests quickly. ??They earned their tip. ??Our server at Junior's - hardly. We went next door after our un-fantastic meal and ordered a blueberry cheesecake to go. ??We left it in the fridge for about a week before we ate it, but it still tasted surprisingly good. ??The cheesecake is the only reason why Junior's Times Square gets two stars from this Yelper. By the way, I'm still on the hunt for the best deli experience in town. ??If you have any suggestions, please send them my way."
3,1,"Cute inside, nice staff, great menu choices. Wish I could've tried more dishes! Bacon-wrapped scallops - these were a little on the salty side, but still tasty. the apple salad situation that came with was a surprising but great touch. Mac and cheese side: I mean mac and cheese is always good. sad to say this one was mediocre on the scale of mac and cheeses I've had in my life, underwhelmed. Mushroom-encrusted chicken: holy amazing delicious. perfect textures, the pea risotto was excellent as well. Rose sangria: yes. si. oui. My friend got the butternut squash ravioli, which was also wonderful. We passed on dessert partly because we were stuffed and partly bc nothing on the dessert list stood out as terribly exciting. Feel like I can get creme br??l??e or molten choc cake anywhere. I wish I could do 3.5 stars, might have to go try more menu items before I make up my mind here."

This raw scallop, lemon confit, broccoli rabe dish was really refreshing and memorable. ?? Nothing a home cook like myself could dream up. ??The favorite at the table was a desert. ??Tangerine, pop corn, ice cream thing that hit ya mouth in all kinds of strange and wonderful ways. ?? By the time we left, we were all the exact perfect amount of full and all agreed we'd had a great meal. ??It's on the high price point but not over the top. ?? Affordable for a working stiff a few times a year."
2,-1,"The food is great and at a very reasonable price. The management, however, is horrible. Was there today for the second time and the manager made a scene in the middle of the restaurant, yelling at my waitress to ""wake up!"" and other things that shouldn't be repeated on yelp. Needless to say, they lost a potential life long customer."

4,1,"Very small restaurant, and a traditional tapas place. We had the scallops, baked stuffed clams and lamp chops. Everything we ordered was good, nothing out of this world. The baked stuffed clams were the best. The place is quite expense, around 10 to 15 for each Tapas place, and you need at least two to feel full, however it is in Greenwich. The service here was excellent, very friendly hostess and nice waiters."
3,1,"Lychee martinis for $5 -AND they're really delicious, too!! Only downside is the place was so small I felt so claustrophobic and my friend and I left almost as soon as we got there!! We drank our martinis and rushed out the door to get some air!! Maybe I'll return to check this place out during the day when it's not as crowded."
5,-1,"Just awesome, must eat while in NYC. ??There is NO better falafel joint I've ever been to. ??Also who can beat an awesome meal for $2? ??Make sure to try the hot sauce... but beware it is HOT. ??Your lips will start to burn after a few bites?"
3,-1,"This proves that ""greasy spoon"" can be a banner to fly proudly. ??The food is great, satisfying and reasonable. ??You can find all your favorite artery cloggers here, and they're all really flavorful and well-made. ??Great burgers. ??And the surroundings are really fun. ??It's a ""dive"" but with a wink and a smile. ??Nice folks behind the counter, too."
5,1,"For whatever it's worth: ??my Japanese hair dresser thinks Ippudo has the best ramen in NYC, closest to the ones she's had in Tokyo. I guess the 1,000-plus reviews and the overall high-star rating attest to the quality of this place. ?? My favorite ramen: ??Akamaru Modern. ?? The $15 ramen price tag may deter some people, but, believe me, it's worth it. ?? You will never think of ramen the same way again."
5,-1,"Decent prices for amazing food. ??Had the Chicken Kebob Sandwich, meat was tender, juicy. ??Not dry like many other places. ??Also had the Baklava, YUM! The only con was, the location I had been to was quite small. But totally worth the wait for its amazing food."
4,-1,great pizza in this neighborhood restaurant. Nice brick oven flavor and lots of options for topins and crust. Nice ambience also.
4,-1,"Pretty good food and a fun atmosphere. ??Not the best Ukrainian food (I personally think the Ukrainian restaurant on 2nd ave and 9th st is better), but the Borsch was excellent. ??Also on the touristy side."
4,-1,"Two dollars fifty for a super fresh falafel sandwich is a big winner in my book. I can't give the place five stars because nothing will ever live up to my glorified memories of Amsterdam Falafel's topping bar in DC, but this is pretty darn good for a classically topped falafel. Sandwich is a half pita filled with falafel balls, tahini sauce, lettuce, and tomato. You can add hot sauce from the giant squeeze bottle on the first of the two tables inside. The line moves faster than you could believe. Remember to grab a bunch of napkins on your way out the door. I tried the shwarma and wasn't a fan -- too greasy for me -- but I don't think I really like beef shawarma and so can't count that against Mamoun's."
5,-1,"Me and my boyfriend love this restaurant. Our waitress was friendly and prompt and took care of us. Food is just delicious, ??and desserts is woow. will recommend and will be back ."
4,-1,"I used to just come here for coffee or bubble tea, which was good. But I recently tried one of their spicy sandwiches. I can't handle spicy, so it was a slightly painful experience. But you know what? It tasted good. I don't know how they do it. I'll have it again, only with a whole bottle of water or milk to cool down. No pain, no gain, and that spicy pork sandwich with peppers is a perfect example."
2,1,"meh - this place is more than a bit hyped. ??Trekked here recently with The Gentle Man, specifically for the pizza, and we were underwhelmed to say the least. ?? I never understand why any hostess would seat a large party next to a two-top at a communal table, when there are like 5 other open tables nearby. ??NYC is cramped enough, can you just spread the table love around a bit more? ??Your patrons will silently thank you and your servers won't get their sections slammed at once. ??New table mates and their annoying conversations aside, we dug in to our apps. ??The bib lettuce ??salad was a generous portion and pretty tasty with the blue cheese. ??The dandelion greens were too bitter for me, had thick bacon bits, poached duck egg and ramps. ??I kept thinking this was like a Paul Bunyan salad, whatever that means. ?? Pizza tasted alright - had a thin bottom but a thick crust. ??It was both soggy and burnt in places. ??Quite the combo. ??Our waitress was nice enough but trailed off into the unknown, towards the end of the meal and we had to flag her down for water and then again for our check. ??By the time we left, it got crazy packed with the too cool for school crowd, too much spandex and plenty of ironic mustaches with attitude. Bye! I'm big a fan of supporting urban/rooftop gardening, but this fact isn't gonna compel me back to Roberta's. ??The bottle of wine we got was great, but that's about it. ??Alas."
4,1,"Very rich and hearty dishes served with personal warmth in a small, unpretentious setting. A great place to fill up."
5,1,"I'm a true Chinese and if you're looking to try true Chinese comfort food you must come here. For me roast pork and duck with rice is simply the dish I'd never get tired of eating. Not to mention it costs about 5.75$ only. The only drawback is that the place may get jammed packed over busy hours and the staff isn't as delightful as we would wish. But who cares , for that pork and duck I'd take hitler for a waiter and still eat there. ??Also, the place's been there for over 25 years, it's gotta be good"
2,-1,"I have been to Pig and Khao twice, the first time I had the tasting menu and it was phenomenal. I liked it so much that when I had friends from LA in town I made a reservation to take them here. On a positive note, most of the food was great. We loved the coconut rice, green mango salad, and shan noodles. However, the service was so bad that I was embarassed that I brought my friends here. We were seated toward the front of the restaurant, and it was Memorial Day weekend, so perhaps our table was forgotten about, or it was a smaller staff-but we sat at our table for 20 minutes being ignored while waitresses passed us. It was clear that we needed to be helped, we had our menus closed and we had been there quite awhile. We finally flagged down the hostess who took our orders very quickly, was not very helpful with our questions, and it was clear she did not want to serve us. It took another 20 minutes for us to get our drinks, and once we had finished those no one came around to ask us if we wanted another. The entire experience we had no waiter or waitress and had to keep flagging people down to help us. In addition, the hostess (not waitress) told us that she recommended 5-7 dishes for 4 girls. We ordered 5 and thankfully did not order more. The portion sizes are way too big to recommend that many dishes, and we only finished half of our meal. I really want to love this restaurant, but there are too many choices in New York for me to consider going back, after my second experience there."
5,-1,I was searching on yelp a good restaurant around Central Park for my 30th birthday and found Villagio interesting. It was worth the 2h30 NYC traffic. The service is top notch. Very reasonable prices. Portion were big and it's probably the italian dish I ate in my life. This is the place to go.
4,-1,"The good the bad the ugly...foie gras donut I want to have sex with, pickle back you know it like a poet babydoll, raw pork chop say what? Adventurous hipster cuisine, our way or the highway attitude, not for the culinary faint of heart...me likey long time!"

5,-1,I'm a sucker for unlimited sangria.
2,1,"Wanted this place to be good, but the food was mediocre and the service was lacking. ??Ordered pickles which was the most exciting thing on the menu and the waiter forgot to bring them. ??Food was luke warm and bland. ??Biscuits and gravy is one of my favorite things and I wanted this place to be a new go to.. and it was underwhelming. ??The decor was the best part about it. ?? Won't be back!!!"
5,1,"Everytime I go here for lunch I enjoy the food more and more. ??The staff is really nice, the ambiance is relaxed and you can just sit and enjoy the food and company. ??The best thing I have had here was the corn soup, velvety smooth."
5,1,"The best falafel I have ever tried, bar none. I have tried the chicken shawarma and the falafel pita, both of which are absolutely amazing. Service here is lightning fast and pretty friendly. Prices are very reasonable too. Note that there is very limited seating inside so I would recommend making the short walk to Washington Square Park and eating there. If you're in the area, don't miss Mamoun's Falafel!"
5,-1,"My wife and I recently ate at Graffiti, and we simply loved it. ??The flavors are spectacular: ??we shared the watermelon/feta/mint sorbet salad, green mango paneer, pork buns, zucchini/hummus pizza, and Graffiti burger, and we enjoyed every dish immensely. ??I also had the lychee martini and loved it. ??Plus, the service was great (I liked that the waiter described each dish in detail), and it was a treat to meet Chef Mehta. ??I highly recommend this restaurant."
4,1,"Great ingredients, yummy warm falafel, and a variety of different combinations. ??You can get a pita or a salad and choose one of the choices they have (Greek, French, etc. - I got the African and really enjoyed it, especially the sauce, which was actually spicy) or select your own toppings. ??Seating is limited."
4,1,"i was meeting an old-time HS friend (hadn't seen her in nearly five years) for a late lunch, and i was starving by the time i met up with her. On top of that, we had to walk quite a distance to the restaurant. BUT, it was worth it. Hands down, Cuban food is good. It was a Sunday afternoon, and it wasn't busy at all. It would be a perfect spot for a date. Very intimate setting, and our waitress was really sweet. She highly recommended the picadillo, which is basically a meat hash. I was a bit leery because it contains raisins- not a fan of savory-sweet dishes. But, i decided to venture out and be adventurous- OMG!!!- it was yummy! The mixed flavors of the tomatoes, onions, and olives really come through with the addition of the raisins. it was amazing. Plus, it came with fried plaintains- so i was very happy. My friend ordered this butter garlic shrimp dish, which she raves about. It looked good too, but i was too busy enjoying my meal. The only reason why i didn't give it 5 stars is that i only tried this place once, which is such a shame. i wish i could have tried everything. Oh well!! It's a great incentive to visit NY and try this place again. Afterwards, we walked around and randomly found this ice-cream shop on Avenue B. So, perfect way to end the meal. ** Note- It's a cash-only spot."
5,1,"Whoa- if you're considering just go RIGHT now-- this is THE best brisket EVER. Thick, charred, spiced crust around fall apart/melt away meat. We went last night and had the brisket, pulled pork, cornbread, collard greens. I was so delightfully surprised with the collard greens too-- they tasted like they'd been tossed in a spicy vinegar; it was so unexpected and sooo welcomed. The environment was dim and hip. Go there!! Service was theatrical and attentive!"
4,-1,"This place has a lot of potential. ??The food was good, the wine on tap very drinkable, the service friendly. ??It just doesn't seem to all come together yet - maybe that takes time with a new restaurant. ??The booth at the back of the restaurant has a direct view of the kitchen and exposure to the bright light that is there, which kind of ruins the ambiance at those seats. ??Once we were moved to another table (which they honored without complaint), I enjoyed the place a lot more. ??Looking forward to seeing how they adapt the menu to the spring weather."
4,-1,"Thai Steak & Noodle Salad was great. ??Sweet mangos, tangy sauce, crunchy peanuts, and soft meat. ??My taste buds were dancing from all the flavors!"
4,-1,As good as the reviewers say it is. Duck is pretty special.
4,-1,"A great little place! So fun to try so many different types of oysters. ??I haven't tried the rest of the food, but will update when I do. ??Only wish that there were more wine/drink ??options and that they took reservations."
3,-1,"Had Charcoal Chicken with a cup of cappuccino for lunch. ??The meat is on the lighter side, the taste is sweet. ??I also like the little heart on my cappuccino. ??I know it was lunch time, all of the stuffs were very serious, no smile at all. ??I don't feel the ""completely at home"" experience."
3,1,"I went to Caracas with my bff who was in town for labor day weekend and I suggested we try it because the place was recommended to me by a friend who said that this place was & I quote: ""WAY BETTER"" then my usual Venezuelan arepa spot out here in Queens. ??Let me start off by how trendy and cute the decor of the restaurant was. It definitely has a date nite feel but still welcomes all kinds of parties. ??We were immediately seated as the place was not at all too busy. ??I look at the menu and there are all sorts of interesting apps to try and I was pleased to see they had the same arepas that I usually get at Arepas Cafe in Astoria. ??I was in the mood for a beer so I was excited to have some ""cervesa polar"" BUT sadly they didn't have it on the menu (point Arepas cafe for carrying my Venezuelan beer!). I ended up having a caipirinha which was ok but really not fufilling my crave for the beer. My bff and I decided to try an app and we picked the croquetas which were very delicious so things seemed to be looking up as far as the food went. ??We then ordered our arepas. ??I ordered only one thinking I wouldn't be able to eat another since I usually tend to get stuffed with JUST ONE, not to mention we had also already had the croquetas before hand. My aprepa pabellon came out and I was a little disappointed that instead of actual shredded cheese on it, they seemed to have poured what looked like Parmesan cheese on it, WOMP. ??The arepa itself was ok though didn't really satisfy my arepa craving and I was still a little hungry. ??All I kept thinking of is how much better the arepas are in Arepas Cafe! ??Then my bff confirmed that her arepas weren't as good as the one's we usually get at Arepas cafe and that just validated what I was feeling! ??All in all it's not a bad place to eat. I did like the app selection, the decor was cute and the arepas were good but just not spectacular. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll definitely give it another shot but for now I remain an Arepas Cafe Fan! ??I just feel like they stay truer to the homemade Venezuelan arepa steelo ;)"
5,1,"I always try their app specials. Last time I had the gator balls, this time the calamari with cherry pepper marinara..super delicious. The boudin balls are amazing as well. This time I had the fried catfish po'boy, it was SO perfect. It wasn't overly breaded, as has sometimes been my experience in the past when cornmeal is involved, it was light and crispy and the catfish was fresh and juicy. The pickles are the best pickles I have ever had. The bread is shipped all the way from Gambino's in NOLA and is the obvious choice as a foundation for an incredible sandwich--soft and light and perfectly crusty where it needs to be. My girlfriend had the jambalaya with an add-on of fried shrimp--it was incredible, perfectly spiced, a must try with your favorite add-on. This place has never let me down. The Sugar Honey Iced Tea is perfection, the Abita jockamo is my new favorite beer and the pimms cup is amazingly refreshing on a hot Summer day. If you haven't gotten your sugar freak on yet don't hesitate any longer!!! You can't go wrong here. Definitely my go-to place to have a casual, reasonably priced meal in a homey, warm, atmosphere with stellar service and DELICIOUS food. P.S. A big thanks to the owner for the complimentary banana pudding, it's a new addiction of ours!"
5,1,"Came in with friends on NYE to fill up before we headed out. Atmosphere: ??Had a fun NYE theme to it with balloons, streamers, everyone was dressed up, they had tables with a prix fix menu but allowed a la carte at the diner/stools. ??We opted for the a la carte menu. Food: ??Was great and flavorful. ??We had the Lomo Saltado, Pollo Sandwich, and Churrasco. ??Portions were generous and the presentation was nice. ??The bartender/waiter was friendly and courteous as were all the patrons there. ??I personally loved the Lomo Saltado and would def. recommend it! ??Satisfied all of my cravings and kept me full throughout the night! Overall: ??Would def. return again for a late night bite in NYC area and would recommend to all!"
5,-1,"Our friends and I from Australia visited Bistango for dinner this week. One of our party of 4 is gluten intolerant. We struggled all week to find gluten free food until we came across this wonderful restaurant. The other 3 members of our party all ordered ""normal"" meals and thoroughly enjoyed our pasta chicken dishes. This restaurant is for ALL lovers of good Italian food and the Red Velvet cake is to die for. The service was outstanding, the best we've had in New York since arriving. Combine all these factors with reasonable prices for both food and wine,this restaurant is a sure fire winner."
5,1,"Just went there for brunch today! ??Nice and quaint spot. Very authentic, just like the places I've been to in London.

1,-1,"I have never done this before..... I purchased the food.... I took one bite, then I got up and left. ?? The pulled pork looked like a used and soiled diaper.... The pork belly was one large piece of fat, not even one whisp of meat.... ??The fried chicken bun was OK...edible but slightly tough...... ??I was so excited to hear about their opening because I live in the area and I love pork buns, but I will NEVER come back..... ??I hope they can get their act together....."
4,-1,"I want to give 1 star so fewer people go. This is always my first attempt at food when doing what I call the West Village Wander, and my intro to the West Village for friends coming to visit. ??It is small, but every table has a good view of 4th St, and despite the close quarters, it feels intimate and private. ??The steals are the game meat tapas on the specials menu and the paella (which is almost a meal on its own). Everything is well made with attention to detail, and I've never had anything here that was a half-a**ed attempt at food, although a there have been a few dishes that didn't suit my palate. Last time I was here, I asked the manager for a flight of wines for tasting, and she obliged (even though it wasn't on the menu)."
4,1,"in continuing my search for awesome and authentic Japanese food, I found this place via a google search. One thing I had yet to find in NYC, was an establishment that create the yumminess of Japanese style crepes, so famously sold in Harajuku/takeshita street., until I found this place. ?? Though they did not have as many options as those trucks on Takeshita street (doesn't matter, I'm a dessert crepe fan anyhow), the options that were available all seemed yummy. I ordered the Harajuku fruit cocktail, received it about 5 minutes later, hopped on the uptown 6 train (which is less than 10 feet from the store front) and devoured it by the time I'd gotten to Astor place (two stops away). LOVED it! I have to say that it wasn't as sweet as the ones eaten in japan, but it damn sure came close the deliciousness I'vd been craving since my last night in japan (it was the 2nd to last thing I ate while in japan). Loved it, and will be back!"
4,-1,"I researched this place before coming to NYC. It was one of my least confident picks, as I had the impression that this was run in a chain of restaurants. Never a good sign in my book. However, we were quite surprised by some of the very peculiar things available from the menu. Staff was right there when we needed them, and food was quite excellent. My wife had the bass and I myself had the rack of lamb, which was cooked to order (a point) without much hassle, although it took a bit longer. Good value, but a busy place."
3,-1,"Ok so i went here today and the service was great. The staff was very sweet. However, the food...meh! The sheep's mill ricotta and grandmothers ravioli;both signature dishes of the restaurant, were rather ..well sub standard. The bloody mary however was good and the lemon tart was fantastic."
4,-1,"I ADORE this gem out in the country (ya I said it) I have heard how amazing it is for the past couple months; and have finally enjoyed the food nirvana about 2 Fridays ago...better late than never! ??Since my first exposure to this amazing restaurant, I have been here 3 times. ??I can safely say that I am addicted to the Italian goodness! The crostini di avocado is a great way to start the dining adventure. ??The fresh avocado and olive oil complimented by the earthiness of provolone is a calculated and successful decision by the chef. ??I am always wanting more! ??Gnocchi al Brivido, Rigatoni Caprese, and the sea bass special are to die for. ??Again, the ingredients are very fresh and compliment each other very well. ??A party in my mouth! The wine list is extensive and offers various price points. ??I have not ordered a ""bad"" wine yet. The servers are always helpful and entertaining. ??I am usually laughing for the majority of my dining experience, and it is not always because of my friends. ??Many of the servers crack me up. The space is perfect for a romantic evening or a gal pal night out. ??I can sit by the front window and people watch or sit in the intimate, second dining room and relax, while enjoying my evening out. Will I be back here again?!? ??Heck, yeah!! ??Probably within the next month or two..."
1,-1,"My girlfriend and I went to eat at Carino the other night. We went based on all the rave reviews on Yelp and had high hopes for the place. I asked the waitress what was most popular on the menu and she recommended the fish tacos, which I ordered. My girlfriend ordered the pork enchiladas and we also got the tamale app and guacamole. The guacamole was pretty good but did not come with enough chips (you have to order chips al la carte for an additional three dollars.) But the guac turned out to be the best part of the meal. The tamale was dry and flavorless, not to mention cold. In fact everything that we were served was luke warm to cold. We ended up having to send the enchiladas back to be warmed up (which we never do, we both wait tables and try our best to be easy customers when we go out) They came back a few degrees warmer than they had first come but still not satisfyingly warm. Plus they were drenched in this weird orange sauce, ick. My fish tacos were also cold and generally flavorless, plus I only got two for a staggering 12 dollars or something insane. Beans and rice you have to order al la carte to help supplement the hunger that you will be feeling after eating such small and dull portions. I ordered a tequila and grapefruit cocktail which was not bad but did not take the edge off having to reach in to my wallet and shell out sixty bucks for an extremely unsatisfying meal. I would never recommend this place to anyone. You can get better mexican food from a truck."
4,-1,"Really tasty food. Service has always been fine every time my wife and I have gone. Only downside is they don't take CCards, cash only. Bummer. The lasagna bolognese is pretty awesome. I'd go more often and give a 5 star if they took CC."
5,1,"I went to this wonderful restaurant about two weeks ago, and vowed to write my first ever restaurant review! Yes, it took me two weeks to finally have the time to sit down and write it, but it deserved to be written about, no matter how long it took for me to complete. This restaurant is amazing. I found it on yelp when looking for a restaurant in the area I was in at the time. I LOVE Mexican food ( and basically all kinds of Latin food to be exact). The food here was perfection!!!! Light, crisp, bursting with flavor in every single bite!!! I live in Brooklyn, in an area with no Latin food restaurants whatsoever! Or taste buds for that matter! Big difference, having moved from the city almost a year ago, with different food choices galore! I'm miserable here! But thinking about Carino, and that wonderful food, with wonderful service!!! Just makes me feel all warm and tingly inside. The waitress, was extremely attentive and very welcoming. I cannot say enough great things about this place! I need to go back right away!!!!"

1,-1,"Awful!!! No stars would have been my choice. Used to be good but 4 of us recently went and will never return. As a native New Yorker and former downtown resident, I used to go there fairly regularly. Service was super rude to the point of me writing to the GM. He ""invited"" us back but I won't spend a dime for abysmal service - you don't have to either with so many excellent places to eat!"
5,1,"Adorable, cozy, cafe. Yummy sandwiches, and everything is at a great price. You can either meet some girlfriends and chat it up, or hide out in a corner and write a novel. The employees are really nice and down to earth too! I'll definitely be going back."

5,-1,"Having real southern cajun-creole food in New York is amazing! Traveling here from New Orleans to eat this wonderful food creates for me the cultural memory of growing up and living there. ??All of the Louisiana folks that I have met on my two visits, have found the missing relationship with the types of food they really miss! People linger in this comfortable atmosphere. New Yorkers are discovering this cusine for many for the first time in their lives. ??Whether or not you really get cajun-creole food is not the point. People go out to eat because they are hungry. When the heat hit New York this weekend, people wanted the comfort food that Sugar Freak ??offers. Congratulations to the owners and to the Chef Airis, thank you for sharing a taste of southern living to New York Bon Appetit!"
5,-1,"First and foremost, last night was my first time ever setting foot into Fat Buddha. My immediate reaction to the crowd and the atmosphere - this is home. What later went on to enhance this feeling was the way that the staff interacted with the customers, the drinks were superb, the music was on point. What more could I want to celebrate my 21st birthday? Thank you to the Fat Buddha family for making my birthday one to remember! I'll definitely be back for more!"
5,1,Won me over..........they are a great place and great original concept. ??Will be back!!!!
5,1,"I ate here tonight with some old friends on the recommendation of one of them who lives in that neighborhood. The short version: when our waitress came by with my lemonade after I'd tasted everything on my plate, I asked her if it might be okay if I proposed to the chef. I still haven't heard back, so remain optimistic. It's okay that I haven't met him/her. Get the oxtail. It's falling-off-the-bone tender, full of flavors that blend together so deliciously. Get it with the peas and rice mixture, which tastes like it has coconut milk or coconut in it and reminds me of a beloved coconut-rice-beans roasted snack I've eaten in Thailand. I tasted my friend's lamb, and liked the oxtail better. The lemonade was also great, tasting like it had both honey and a little salt in it (may not be to everyone's taste, but I love lemonade with a touch of salt). I didn't like the sorrel drink (note to self: not the same as the lemony sorrel plant I know); it was very sweet. One of my favorite meals in a long time, and I eat a fair share of really delicious meals."
4,-1,"Returning to NY where I grew up and hearing so many good things about BKLYN I asked my friend to take some somewhere that exemplifies the new brooklyn. We chose Buttermilk C and it did not dissappoint. Everything was spot on from the service to the cocktails to the menu. And, the staff is completely real. Would highly recommend this to anyone needing to entertain an out of town guest. ??I love a place where making a menu choice for yourself is a challenge because you don't want miss out on all the great items they offer."
4,1,"Bit surprised at the low ratings here. Even the rating on the former location's page is pretty mediocre. This place has gotten a lot of hype and attention in the various foodie pages, so there is the expectation vs. reality letdown at play. It's definitely not for everyone. But I just don't get people who give this place a 1 star rating just because it's too far out for you. How is it the restaurant's fault where you live? ??Based on where I am, the Upper West Side is out of the way for me. Should I give a 1 star rating to all those places for that? Anyways... Had a very enjoyable dinner here. It's amazing how there's a constant queue of people. I knew this place was popular, but I had no idea just how much. Other than having to wait awhile to be seated (as expected), everything else was great. The service was friendly and attentive despite being busy, and it didn't take that long for the food to come out. We ordered the fish sauce wings and the stewed duck leg. Delish! The wings were crispy, with a sticky, flavorful, spicy coating and moist inside. I love Vietnamese fish sauce, so this was just finger lickin' good! Nice touch having the pickled salad to offset the flavors. Those are some damn good wings! The stewed duck leg was fantastic as well. The duck was wonderfully fatty and juicy and the broth and mushrooms combined to make these wonderfully meaty, earthy flavors. Really tasty."
4,1,"So far I've been to ToJ twice. Once for an early evening dinner and the second time for Sunday brunch. Dinner was pretty good, I had the yellowfin tuna club sandwich, potatoes au gratin, and a beet salad. The sandwich and potatoes were good although the beet salad was a bit plain (jane?) What really stood out was the relaxed and cozy atmosphere. I eat alone quite a bit, and I never felt unwelcome here. Service was friendly and attentive. The hostess especially was very nice. Brunch was an awesome deal for the price ($14, seriously???) For $14 you have your choice of a bunch of different egg, pancake, whatever combos, as well as a drink and a basket of muffins. I went for the eggs benedict and while they weren't the best I'd ever eaten, they definitely hit the spot. Will be back for more soon."
5,-1,"A group of 9 went yesterday for brunch and it was AMAZING!!! ??One had the sturgeon app which was out of this world, we also had the crab croquette which was the best ever and we also had the fried egg and sausage app. ??All of these were sooo tasty and creative. ??On to the entrees which were hanger steak ( great taste) baked eggs (love 'em) and braised short ribs ( never had better). ??The brunch drinks were fantastic, especially the RETOX (tequila, lime ,chili). ??The whole experience, from attentive and friendly staff to atmosphere were incomparable. ??Loved it and will be back for dinner. ??Try it - you'll love it too!!! ??Brooklyn at its best!!! ??Compliments to the CHEF!!!"
4,1,"The big question: is the wait worth it? I was in town visiting when my brother and his fiance kept raving about this new ramen place. Of course, being a lover of food, I HAD TO TRY IT! After making everyone wait for 2.5 hours outside on a cold cold day, we finally got seated. **NOTE: there is no call ahead, you must be there to put your name on the list. There is limited space to stand around and wait, you'll probably be hanging out on the sidewalk in front of this place, and if you miss your name when it's called, they'll put you all the way at the end of the list again. If you ask the host, they'll always quote you an hour wait regardless if it's more or less, don't believe him!** THE RAMEN: I'd have to admit. The ramen is amazing. Ever since I visited Korea and has the ""best"" ramen in my life, everything has been held up to that standard and nothing has come close to beating it. This was pretty amazing. The pork was melt in your mouth. I decided to get extra pork because most places don't give you enough, but trust me, the two pieces that originally come in this ramen should be more than enough. They cut it so thick. The best part, and I beg you to not forget it. GET AN EGG IN YOUR RAMEN!!! It will change your life. So yes, the ramen was good. Yes the ramen is soooo much better than Ippudo but imagining waiting another 2.5 hours for a bowl of ramen... I'm not sure it'll happen again"
3,-1,Totally ??hyped up. It's decent ramen but not the best thing i ever ate. What the hell is with the long arse wait-- 45 mins for a bowl of Ramen....ppsst...i think not. I had to try it once so i could satisfy my curiousity..it's meh....
5,-1,"Occasion: Small gathering (12-20 people) for a City Hall wedding. This was the best location and ??ambiance for our intimate and small wedding party. We loved the restaurant, the decoration is lovely with many details, including the original vespa matching our scooter riders hearts. Our party was a mix of singles, couple and children, and they all loved the place. The service was constantly up to the challenge, from the booking to the final deliverable. The 'Da Mikele' staff knew what to do and they have been keeping check on the table and the guests, always respecting our demand. They went well beyond the duty setting up our tables, organizing flowers and following us during the initial cake and wine photography. It couldn't be any better. we felt like we wanted: an intimate afternoon with friends to joy, relax and laugh all together.This was only possible thanks to the hard work done by the Katia, Alicia, Siria 's team. Thank you again. Food was great, and being my husband italiano, he said it was truly an aperitivo italiano :) Sure we will be back to Da Mikele!"
3,1,"Katsu-Hama's menu is filled with fried items. ??Yes, I realize katsu is in the name of the restaurant, but I didn't realize that nearly everything on the menu would be fried. That being said, I appreciate their specialization. I had the pork katsu which had a nice fry but was generally lacking in flavors and seasoning. ?? The ambience is fine, despite the warnings in other reviews but it's not the reason why you go to the restaurant. I was a little put off by the service - my friend and I split a large beer and the guy just gave us one cup of beer and another cup. I find splitting a large beer pretty standard so I was surprised that he didn't just give us the bottle of beer or pour it into two glasses. Instead, we ended up pouring a lot on the table since it's hard to pour from cup to cup."
4,1,Went in here for a quick dinner. Food was really good. Very cool and peaceful environment. I had the salmon which was fantastic. Wish it was a little bigger but it was delicious. The fresh hand cut fries are just as good with out ketchup. Next time i go i hope to try the burgers which i hear are great. Friendly waiters who check up on you and constantly refill water without asking which is a plus !
2,1,The food was interesting and fun to try. It was too ritzy for me and not my cup of tea. Service was excellent and ambiance is nice.
4,1,"What a lovely restaurant in the UES. It's extremely laid back in here and the decor is homey. Our server was kind but not as attentive as we would have liked. Complimentary bread and olive oil is provided. We decided to start with the Wild Mushrooms, Arugula, & Parmigiano Cheese Bruschetta and Calamari Grigliati. The bread is toasty, warm, and slightly soft in the middle. The mushroom topping was smooth, clean, and perfectly seasoned. The Calamari is lightly breaded and grilled. I could taste a bit of curry powder in the seasoning. The warm calamari and cool salad that comes with this dish work so well together. For Entrees, I was able to try the Gnocchi Di Ricotta and the Vitello Gratinato Con Melanzane (Veal Topped w/ Italian Eggplant). The Gnocchi is cooked perfectly. It has a nice chew, yet melts in your mouth. The creamy black truffle and chive sauce is rich and has such depth of flavor. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys gnocchi and creamy sauces. The Veal is light and savory. The eggplant on top melts in your mouth. This dish is packed with flavor. Another winner. It gets packed in here quick, I strongly recommend making reservations. If you're looking for a restaurant that offers quality and delicious food in a relaxed environment, look no further. Uva is where it's at."
5,1,"We went to Olivier last night to grab a quick bite to eat before seeing a show in the local area. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the new menu (launched last night I think) is fantastic and I struggled to make a choice. The food arrived quickly and was very tasty (I had the short ribs and they were great), we squeezed in one dessert to share between us the tarte tatin which again was perfect. They even accommodated my friend who is a vegetarian even though there was no vegetarian item on the menu. They have a small but well formed (and well priced) wine list. Great french bistro food, I highly recommend a visit if you are in the area. We had to rush off to the theatre but I wish we could have stayed longer."
1,-1,"The food is overpriced and watered down to suit those that would live in the area or toward the hotel's clientele (needless to say, the Latin American food I grew up with had richer and more savory flavors, and I've had more authentic food in inexpensive areas). ?? Besides this, my party and I were having a good time until the staff decided to kick us out to serve a larger party that required combining two tables. ??The place was not very busy by any means (another set of tables could have been used) and there wasn't a line outside when we left. Even before that incident, I felt rushed by a particular female waitstaff that tried to take our plates even before most of the party had finished eating. ??One of my family members even felt that the waitstaff were giving us dirty looks to make us leave the table. ??All in all, I felt very unappreciated as a customer and was given the vibe that I didn't belong there. ??That said, I will take my service elsewhere."
4,1,"I believe that all anyone really wants in this life is to sit in peace and eat a sandwich. -Liz Lemon A wiser woman, there might not be. Olea allows a person to do just that. During lunchtime especially, the vibe is so relaxing. I ended up waiting for my friend for about 15 minutes, but the waitress wasn't pushy at all; she just made sure I had something to drink and left me alone. Sure, the pint glasses they use for water have white marks on them (ostensibly from stacking), but I ain't never scurred. The menu is full of all sorts of tempting options, but I narrowed it down to their Chicken Club: chicken breast, bacon, herbed yogurt, endive, roasted tomato-green olive spread. Served on brioche with salad and patatas bravas on the side. And believe me, it's just as tasty as it sounds. It was juicy, full of flavor, and the papas bravas were excellent as well. I can't even tell you how many times I've walked by Olea on the way to and from other engagements, but from now on I'll be walking in, rather than by. Because this adorable little restaurant is warm, welcoming, and they make some damn good food."
5,1,"Can I associate Clinton St. Baking Co. with one word? ??Yes! (that wasn't the word)...... PHENOMENAL. I've been here for brunch at least 6 times over the past year (a testament to my admiration considering I rarely go to the same place more than a few times), so I feel like I can give this place a fair assessment. ??The service is consistently friendly and efficient, the food is excellent, and the wait is worth every long, grueling, I'm so hungry I'm going to keep kicking the tree outside moment. Special props go out to the vanilla buttermilk pancakes with seasonal berries and that delicious maple butter syrup, eggs benedict with hollandaise sauce, and ALL the items on special that I've tried here. ??I had a more lunch-esque crab cake entree once, which I didn't enjoy as much but this is also when it dawned on me that breakfast items for brunch are more of my thing. So camp out on Clinton St. for the night, lurk around the area for a long time after a late Fri or Sat night....do what you gotta do to make sure you eat here! ??Or just endure the long wait, cuz you will not be disappointed. Remember cash and order with your head, not your growling tummy, cuz it's easy to get filled up fast. My #1 brunch spot in the city!"
4,-1,Convenient. Good place to get food and drinks quickly. Well stocked. Low prices. Warm food ready to go. Seatings available for those who want good fast korean food for a quick meal.
4,1,"Finally...that cool Williamsburg bistro with good food, coffee, and tons of character that we've all been looking for...And it's actually in Greenpoint. ??Doh! Okay, what gives on the lack of really great, large cafes in W-burg to hang out and write your first great novel? ??It seems like there would be 50 such places, but no dice. ??I love Margo's, but that's more of a patisserie. ??And Blue Bottle has great coffee, but they are a little snobby and sterile. Griping aside, Milk and Roses is one of the coolest cafe/bistros I've been to in NYC. ??It's a large Italian bistro, with semi-finished wood, old furniture, a garden out back, and menus delivered to you in an envelope. ?? For such a big space, it's surprising not noisy, which is cool. ??And the open-ness of the space did not stop it from feeling somehow intimate. The waitress was professional and maybe a little serious, but ??still friendly. ?? The menu was pretty substantial, with real meals as well as snacks and desserts like croissants. ??I got a latte and a chocolate croissant, health nut that I am. ??Both were solid B+ good. ?? Admittedly, I was there during the day, so all of these notes may change when the wine bar side of it comes out at night, but at least by day, this place hit the spot. ??The food/coffee part of it was in the very good-not-amazing category, but the overall vibe was really great. ?? And exactly what I've been looking for. ?? VoracoMeter=8 (out of 10)"
4,1,"Boyfriend and I came here prior to seeing a show on a Wednesday night. ??(He paid for tickets, I picked up dinner, he's a lucky guy.) ??We made a 6pm reservation, which I'm glad we did because there was a line out the door when we left. ??Overall, pretty happy with dinner. ??The $25 wine list is a great option and the waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the wine, because I was pretty much taking a shot in the dark when choosing. ??The bread and olives were a good starter, Caesar salad was creamy, fresh and very good for a pre-course option. ??We got a fried shrimp appetizer. ??It was spicy and delicious. ??He ordered swordfish, which he enjoyed. ??I ordered the lamb, which was nice and peppery and tender. ??It was a sizable portion, but not so much that I felt I was wasting half my meal. ??With his help, I was able to finish almost all of it. ??Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time for dessert, we should have mentioned we had a show at the beginning of the meal. ??My biggest complaint would be that our table was too small, I felt like one wrong move and the wine bottle would be on the floor. ??After we got rid of the bread box, it was much better. ??Boyfriend also thought it was a tad too loud, though he's deaf in one ear, so I don't know how much you can trust his opinion. ??The bar area seemed much louder, luckily we were sitting in the back. ??For a NYC dinner, it was definitely not too expensive. ??Without an appetizer, you could easily spend under $100 for two even with the wine. ??We would come back here again. ??I'd definitely recommend this as a pre-show restaurant."
4,-1,Crazy for hugs and crazy for Hanco's.
5,-1,"Amazing!!! The Grimaldi's haven't skipped a beat. The pizza and service was out of this world, and our experience was everything we expected and more. Definitely returning with family and friends for any/every occasion. Congrats on a restaurant VERY well done! :D"
2,-1,"I have been to Becco many times for lunch with my wife and have had good experiences. This last time I took the entire family in the hope they would experience a knock your socks off Italian dinner in the Big Apple. Wrong! The place was packed so tight to the point that there could not have been a comfortable person in the place. The A\C was obviously out matched as everyone was sweating. Look, I realize this is New York and a restaurant has to maximize the dollar per square foot but there comes a point where guests are so uncomfortable that no matter how good the food is they will not return. Becco is at that point. The food was good but with so many other great restaurants to pick from why would I go back?"
4,1,"Loved this place. I had the eggs benedict with chicken sausage which was amazing. The complementary blood orange mimosa was divine as well. My friend had a salmon egg scramble with ricotta that was delicious. All in all a great experience, excellent service, and delish food and drinks."
5,1,"I take Yelp recommendations very, very seriously. So when Lan Zhou Handmade Noodles repeatedly was at the top of the most reviewed list, I knew I had to make the trip to the labyrinth that is Chinatown. Inconspicuous and neatly camouflaged against the bustling Chinatown backdrop, Lan Zhou is truly an indubitable hole in the wall. Small groups and single diners came in and out at a steady stream, slurping steaming bowls of hot hand-pulled noodle soups and scarfing down freshly crafted boiled and fried dumplings. My friend and I tried the oxtail noodle soup and the beef brisket noodle soup with an order of boiled dumplings and an order of fried dumplings. ??The noodles were perfectly al dente, doughy, and comforting. The broth was delightfully salty and savory (tons of MSG - my body will decompose nicely when I'm dead) and the portions were HUGE. I am not a light eater by any means and there was still a hefty pile of noodles in my bowl at the end of the meal. The dumplings were SO good. For lack of eloquency, all I can say is that they were the BOMB.COM. No soy sauce needed, my friends. So, two bowls of noodles, 2 orders of dumplings, one Diet Coke, and one regular Coke = $17. I still like to think of myself as a poor, degenerate college student so this meal was a steal. This place is awesome. Game over."
5,-1,"AMAZING experience. First off, we didn't have a reservation for Sunday brunch, and not only did the gracious host and hostess seat us, but even let us move tables when my aunt wasn't happy. Our waitress, Jack, was lovely, so helpful, and patient. We started with their house made sodas which were beautiful, the savory crab toast with aioli, split the shrimp salad, which had an amazing vinaigrette, and finished it off with the orgasmic mushroom and parmesan pizza with a cracked egg in the middle. It took a while for our pizza to come out, but Jack over heard that we were thinking about the roasted brussels sprouts and sent them out on the house. She also over heard it was my birthday that past weekend and sent out an adorable cupcake with a candle. Fantastic service with an incredible eye for detail. DEFINITELY come back!"
5,1,"I can't believe its taken me this long to write a review for this place. Every time I come no matter what time of day it's the same crew working. Quality food at affordable prices. I usually just order a meat and house fried rice. The fried rice is delicious and unless you seriously want to stuff yourself you will have enough to take home. I recently came for their lunch special and ordered the seafood lunch special. I forget exactly what it was called but it was an assortment of sea food for $8. I think it was the second item listed on the lunch special page. Anyways this is my new favorite dish. The reason why I'm rating them as ??5 stars is because of the chili oil they serve (hard to find in the U.S. and something I grew up with), consistent quality and down to earth vibe. Also, not a bad place to catch a beer and watch some TV late at night."
5,1,"I finally understand what all the hype is about. Came here on a Thursday afternoon, at 12:30 pm, thinking the line wouldn't be too bad since it was a weekday. My friends and I still had to wait over an hour. However, the wait was worth it. We shared the February pancake month special, crunchy banana with chocolate chili cinnamon sauce, potato pancakes with applesauce, and a side of bacon. Best potato pancakes I have ever tasted and fantastic banana pancakes. Bacon was delicious too! The food here really is the best. Don't forget, this place is cash only!"
3,1,"i was expecting a lot more from this place especially after reading the reviews and from the word on the street from my neighbors. i brought my sister here b/c for some reason this place comes up when i search ""gluten free carroll gardens"", but it doesn't really have a lot in that department let alone gluten free rolls on the brunch menu. ??that being said: my brother in law got a heart attack on THREE plates with pretty much everything fried and i ordered the lox plater. ??the salmon was DELICIOUS and super thinly sliced with pumpernickel bread. ??i didn't think that the fried capers would add that much to the dish, but they complimented the fish perfectly! ?? with a three dollar cup of coffee and small portions to boot, buttermilk channel will get the good old A-OK... impress me for dinner or else i will not return. ps: be prepared to wait because this place is a hipster's paradise. ??farm to table much??"

4,-1,"I'd written a negative review about Almond before. First, my review was filtered. So I wrote an 'update' and it apparently went through. Long story short, had a solid meal there but service was not good. Management seemed to be aware of this but only reached out to part of our group to make amends, ignoring the rest of us. The owner reached out to me through yelp to directly apologize. I really appreciate that, it's great to see a business owner at a high volume restaurant who cares to reach out to individuals, and i'm confident that next time I'm there - on my next trip to New York - ??the experience will be different. So, I'm now a fan of Almond. The food was good from the beginning, now I know they take pains to follow up and reach out to customers who aren't happy with service."
3,-1,"Pros: The Smith is lively, raucous, young and fun. The food is hearty, robust and flavorful. The cocktails, along with the rest of the menu, were surprisingly affordable (for downtown Manhattan). The service is friendly. Cons: Loud. Like Madison Square Garden loud. The room is sprawling, and while the decor seems to reach for bordello-brasserie, it's never quite distinctive or intimate. The clientele mostly wore jeans and I saw more than a few BoSox caps (no offense to Boston fans but dude, if there's a wine list, take off your hat!). Conclusion: The Smith is a great place for a group, a college reunion, or an internet date where you want to be easily distracted. Not so much for romance. But hell, you can't have it all. . .(and the chocolate sundae was good!)"
3,1,I don't get the hype. ??The pancakes are good but not that much better than any competent cook can make for themselves at home. ??The highlight of the meal was actually the truffle fried eggs.
5,1,"Excellent! ??This place has been there since 1868 so I'm sure it has seen it's changes. ??Well, I just went there tonight (Sept 2009) and I must say it is fantastic! ??The best money I've spent on my trip to New York City so far. ?? Service = excellent Value = excellent Food = excellent A true Irish Tavern. ??Forget the Irish Rogue (that place was NOT an irish pub at all) nor was the Playwright Celtic Bar, nor was Smith's. Landmark Tavern is THE best Irish Taven in New York. ??Rich with history, traditional and authentic. ??I loved it and can't say enough good things. ?? We ate: Potato soup - phenomenal House Salad - their vinaigrette was outstanding, wonderful salad! Cheeseburger - pretty good (not the best) Fish and chips - BEST EVER! ?? Homemade vanilla and hazelnut ice cream - very good Smithwick's (on tap) - not sure why, but it tasted better there than any other bar since I started drinkin' the best Irish Beer made total bill = $55 !!! To give you an idea we had Italian at Grotta Azzurra in Little Italy and it was NOT very good at all (bad service too): ??$87 with 4 glasses of wine and no apps. ?? I will be going back to Landmark Tavern at lest 2 more times before I leave NY. ??I want to try the Lamb Shanks and the Duck and anything else I can manage to swallow. ?? I have no idea why we left after dinner. ??We thought we would go to another ""Irish Pub"" but could not find one. ??Landmark operates as a true pub/bar after 11:30pm - 3am. ??Huge mistake was leaving thinking there would be somewhere better. ?? The patrons there were not tourists, and were 30's and older. ??I'm younger than 30 but it was a fun crowd and we enjoyed it. ?? I have heard this is a hidden Irish Gem, and it truly is. ??I will second the other review that said it's hard to write about it, because you don't want everyone to know about it and ruin it."

5,1,"4.5 stars Oink, oink, oink. Piggy coming through. I almost had to be rolled out of this place after the all you can eat pasta. You get three different kinds served to you and they are pretty delicious. Normally I'm really good about eating a moderate amount even if the portions are unlimited... but the buttery goodness of the stuffed pasta and the other pasta servings were too much to resist. The three pasta choices were linguine with clam sauce, swiss chard-stuffed ravioli with brown butter sauce, and thenpenne with some sort of tomato sauce (basil marinara?). All I can say is recalling from memory they were all good, with the stuffed pasta being the best. They allowed you to try a little of each so then i was able to decide which one I liked best and get more of that afterwards. Other good things were the appetizer. I had the antipasto Misto. This was very well done and was light and tasty (not too filling to spoil your appetite, but enough so you could wait for your food). I appreciated the generous serving of seafood provided. ??My friends also took advantage of the extensive wine list of wines for $25 bucks. Besides pasta they had lots of other serving choices and some of my friends got the steak. I was able to taste some of it (the serving size is HUGE) and it was quite tasty. All in all this restaurant is pretty nice and the prices are pretty good for nyc. I have enjoyed seeing Lidia cook on her pbs cooking show so it was cool to go to her restaurant. Definitely recommend coming here!"
2,-1,"Okay, so aside from a slice of pizza being insanely expensive, the service was horrendous. I'll give it to the manager, who ??tried to reprimand his staff after they were incredibly RUDE to me and my party (hence the two stars) ....However, maybe he saw me pull out my Yelp app and wanted to try and stop me dead in my tracks... Either way, I won't be making another visit to this pizzeria/bar."
2,1,"This is one of the most overrated restaurants in Astoria. This is a hit or a miss place based on days. I decided to write this review to let the other yelpers know how rude the bartender was. We came here for dinner last week and the place was packed. The host was nice and suggested that we wait at the bar for 10-15 minutes and we obliged. There were 4 vacant bar stools, 2 at each ends and two girls were sitting in the middle. We wanted to move one chair so that we 3 can sit together and the bartender would not allow it. One of the girls offered to move to the adjacent seat so that we can be accommodated but the bartender told her not to worry about it. I did not want to stay there even for a minute after such horrendous treatment and we walked right out after suggesting him to learn a thing or two about customer service."

4,1,"Small, tight spaces, and simple decor. Enough space for maybe 3-4 groups at most. Think homestyle Japanese food...with a lot of fried chicken. Garlic fried chicken was delicious (all meat no bones) but the batter was extremely salty...seasoned too well. Served with rice, but soup was extra. The dark cramped atmosphere reminded me of similar venues in Tokyo...minus the really old drunk Japanese men and the lack of characteristic grunge. They have a nice selection of sake served hot or cold! Cash only!! Service could have been a bit quicker for sure, but understandable with only one waiter."

4,1,"Beautiful ambiance and atmosphere with great prices... First, let's start with the obvious ??-- this place is GORGEOUS for a small, Thai restaurant in the sea of ethnic cuisine offerings in this restaurant-rich neighborhood. ??Just look at the pictures! ??A bright, gigantic chandelier encased in glass is surrounded by damask wall paper in a dark, romantic setting. ??The waiters are always dressed in chic black outfits and are friendly and attentive. ??No matter how full or empty, this place always seems to be well staffed! ?? The cocktail list is intriguing, the drinks are somewhat hotel/travel themed and they also have an array of wines and beers (price range: $7-$12). ??The food is great! ??I recommend the duck salad and the thai salad, which are a great size for one person. ??Menu options here are similar to other Thai restaurants in the area (...think Yum Yum prices -- minus the specials -- with upscale decor). ??The music is usually lounge-y and chill (though this may be because I have always ended up there on a weekday or early evening during the week). ??I would definitely recommend Room Service."
3,1,Clinton Street Baking Company is one of those places that just let's their food do the talking. When we got there at 10am on a Wednesday we we're told it would be a 30-45 min wait. When we returned 30 minutes later the host told there were still four tables ahead of us and that we needed to wait outside (mind you it was 20 degrees and snowing). Pissed off we decided to head to the next spot. While we were walking to bobwhite counter we got a text saying our table was ready. Begrudgingly we returned. I ordered the Chocolate Chunk Pancakes. They were good as advertised. I'm giving this place three stars for making me wait out in the cold but as far as food goes this place is as good as it gets.
4,1,"Pros: * Comfortable and spacious decor * Great for big groups- there's a center table that is perfect for 14 people. Seriously considering having a small birthday dinner here... * Fast and friendly service * Although overpriced at $5/bun, Zutto serves the best pork buns I've ever had in NYC. My favorite would be the Zutto Pork Belly Buns (caramelized pork, peanuts, sweet & spicy sauce and cilantro). Love the portion size, flavors, and combination of textures of the bun. Way better than Ippudo! * Solid sushi- recommend the Tribeca Roll (spicy tuna, avocado, and caviar in a triangle. * We loved our Bread Pudding dessert - well presented and delicious! Cons: * Compared to Totto Ramen and Minca, the ramen here is unfortunately not as superior. The soup (personally too thick and oily for my tastes) and noodles didn't have the same punch as Totto's. Will stick to pork buns and sushi!"

3,1,"A very fun ambiance, the place is always jam packed. ??A lot of energy, lively and trendy. It's one of a few restaurants that resides in the basement and still draws a crowd. Not a sushi place, but the cooked food/small dishes was pretty good. The price was decent for a time square location. ??I haven't find something signature on the menu that makes me crave and drives me to go back though. I have spent a few nights having good time with friends at the restaurant. I would definitely go again when I'm in the area, just that the wait can be insane at times, and the people there were nice enough not to really rush you once you get seated...at least that's how I remembered it =)"
4,-1,"Food was excellent. Service was great. Great menu. I would absolutely eat there again and again. I did find that the tables in the front window were so close together that you actually have to move your table to get out to use the bathroom, but that is quite a minor issue."
5,-1,Their classic Bahn Mi is really good and one of the best values in the west village for only 5 bucks. Super excited to try out their Pho as it gets colder outside.
5,1,All I have to say is AMAZING! ??The food here is so damn good. Only negative is the long wait time to get a seat. But who cares it's kyclades. I'll wait the hour to eat here. I've come here for years and never a disappointment. Always taken friends here and have left loving the place. If your in Astoria and want Greek food. This is the only place you should stop at. Yummy
5,1,"This place is incredible! Their food is out of this world perfection. Seriously, some of the best hummus I've ever tasted - smooth tasting and well textured. I usually get the Spinach Pie with feta, but have also tried the vegetable kabobs, soups, and desserts and have zero complaints. The owner/manager is also very sweet and accommodating. Still need to try this place for brunch! Definitely one of the better stops in Willburg."
3,1,"this place is so whatever. we ordered their steak salad, which was undercooked. the lobster benedict had about five times the amount of egg as it had lobster, although i did appreciate the biscuits. the cava is overpriced as is every other drink on the menu. their banana bread pudding is good, but then again, it takes a lot to mess that up. the ambiance is unimpressive. the space is awkward- too ample to be cozy yet too cramped to feel spacious. the other thing, they need to invest in some coat hangers. people's coats were falling all over the place, it made me nervous that drinks would spill over."
5,1,"Food: ??Extremely well executed. ??Simple and delicious. Service: ??Professional and cordial. ??Server was EXTREMELY knowledgable and remembered my beverage of choice from previous visit. Ambience: ??I've been in only towards the end of the evening, so it's been mellow and relaxing. ??The music is very cool. ??Reminds me of growing up in Bensonhurst."
4,-1,Fun place and delicious food. ??Had a great raspberry chocolate shake and delicious burgers and fries. ??Staff was friendly and efficient except for one rude Asian waitress who was unfriendly and couldn't be bothered to treat us like paying customers. ??Overall a great place and I would definitely return.
5,1,"I came here for dinner after hearing great things from friends, and it certainly lived up to its reputation. Happy hour cocktails are 2 for the price of one, and the dinner prices were very reasonable. The calamari app was great, very filling, and the sauces were all homemade and delish. For our main course we split the Kangaroo tacos and the Octopus tacos. I hadn't had either before, and they were really good! The staff was really friendly and personable. I Highly recommend this place."
3,1,"The noodles are simple and decent. The soup still makes me thirsty after drinking it. I'm sure it's not a very healthy meal, but it is quick, easy, and convenient."
4,1,"Pretty good hipster pizza. Since I'm so hip (and by that I mean I just read a lot of Yelp reviews before coming), I knew about all of the different pizzas they had, so I was so cool I ordered an off-menu pizza, the Axl Rosenberg (sopressata, mushrooms, double garlic and jalapeno), since it looked really good and wasn't on the menu that day. It was excellent, as was the Beastmaster (port sausage, onions, capers and jalapeno). Not only are the pizzas here great, but they have a wide selection of delicious breads and other foods (I still want to come back to try the burger, which annoyingly seems to only be available on the weekday lunch menu). We started with the Sticky Bun ($2.50), which was a tiny one but ended up being very very good. It's mostly communal seating, with a long single table with bench seats running through the middle of the restaurant, so you will have to put up with listening to a lot of hipster conversation. Also, there is typically an insanely long wait, but if you manage to get in at a time when it's not too long, it's all kind of worth it for the delicious breads and pizzas."
4,1,"Delicious and potent lychee martinis Tasty chicken wings. Good prices. Nice bartender. Very sweet. Good crowd, definitely after work and some. (the happy hour goes until 10 pm.) I was there until ten pm one night. ??I had a few drinks and was quite tipsy by the end of the night. ??Time got away from me as I enjoyed the martinis, eats and good company. ?? I will be back."
3,1,Not worth it!
5,1,"My friends had reservations they could not make and I was looking for a brunch spot to take my boyfriend for his birthday so we used their reservation. We had an absolutely amazing Brunch here. I suggest making reservations as I saw plenty of people waiting while we walked right in. My Boyfriend had the Vaca Frita and I had the Latin Benedict. Both were absolutely amazing! The steak was perfect, the eggs were perfect. The sauces were perfect. Can you tell I'm a fan yet? The service was also perfect. Perfect Sangria too. Overall perfect experience and I shall be returning very soon!"
3,-1,"Bouley is one of the most celebrated restaurants in the country. ??Back in 1996, it occupied a truly unique spot on Duane street in lower Manhattan. ??I used to pass it on the walk home from work everyday and could smell the unbelievable ingredients being prepared inside. ??At that time Bouley was the definitive gold standard of new French restaurants in NY. ??I had the chance to eat at the new Bouley (on West Broadway) one Thanksgiving Holiday a few years ago and unfortunately was extremely underwhelmed. ??Perhaps it was because Mr. Bouley was not in the kitchen that night--but after so much astonoshing praise the experience post Duane Street left a lot to be desired."
5,-1,"Live long enough and you're still bound to be surprised from time to time. ??Earlier this week I took a different route home, on account it wasn't 15 degrees for once, and came upon one of the most eye catching little places I've ever experienced. Warning -- try to avoid making plans for after your visit to Donostia. ?? I wandered into this pace at around 3pm on a Wednesday and ended up staying to almost 10pm. ??Mind you I was not camping, but rather couldn't pry myself away from my bar stool as I ordered item after delicious item from their huge menu. ?? Mostly all i ordered were pintxos and were about 2 to 3 bites in size. ??These things are my new crack rock. ??Started with a tortilla pintxo with morcilla - classic combo. Then i went for the Bonito, Pulpo, and white asparagus in one round -- they were all placed together on a slate board and the arrangement was one of the more artistic things I've seen at a restaurant in some time -- Beautiful and tastes were truly authentic. I've been to Spain twice and only there have I experienced a place like this. ??But I must say, that only goes for the food, because the wine options at this place are much more vast compared to anything I was offered or drank in Span at my favorite neighborhood haunts. ??The bartender recommended a vermouth cocktail when I first arrived and after two subsequent rounds of it I decided it would become my new Spring drink of choice. ??It was comprised of a really tasty red Spanish Vermouth they have on tap and just took some fresh orange rind and a shot of seltzer from their own siphon (the amount of detail put into this place/menu/service is astonishing). ??It tasted like the most delicious and adult ""cola"" one could ever have. ?? From there I moved into a beer -- had a ""cana"" (small size popular in Spain) of a beer I'd never heard of before which the bartender also recommended called Sagra. ??It was full of body and fresh fruit notes and was impressive -- shocked when I learned that it was Spanish as well. ??Later I had a Txakoli they had on tap -- super cool and served in a real txakoli glass no less which I've only ever seen in Spain. ??Settled into a big red wine which my palette was more than ready for called ""aroa"" (not sure if that's spelled right, but bartender will know) -- big and delicious! Finished with what else but a sherry -- they must have had over 20 offerings by the glass of sherries alone. ??- bartender poured me a ""palo cortado"" and I'm still tasting it now days after drinking it given the depth of the finish. I'm heading back tomorrow with a group of my friends who are food fanatics to show off my little discovery. ??As if this place didn't have enough going for it, it even has a cool private table in the back surrounded by wines. ??I saw a party of six sit there during the course of my marathon meal and really got the urge to phone 5 friends and take the table asap. Again, truly surprised with authenticity and food/wine arsenal this place boasts -- especially given its size. ??Most impressed I've been with a new spot since I can recall. ??Back for my ""crack sprinkled"" pintxos shortly."
4,-1,"I must admit, at first when I looked at the food, I lost my appetite a bit. They should definitely work on their presentation. Otherwise the flavors were new and awesome for me. The lotus root fried chips dish - Renkon age is to die for. My friend had the Pork Tatsuta and I was tempted to grab her plate and eat all of that too! The service was decent."
4,1,"I've been to Totto Ramen twice in my life. The first time, I was majorly craving some good ramen, but I wasn't a huge fan of Ippudo so I began to yelp. This place came up and it wasn't too difficult to get to either. The area around it is a bit sketchy and you the actual place is a couple steps down, but it's all good when you get there. I remember going with my mom and as we were walking, she was like, ""Um...where the hell are you taking me?"" It was in such a random place haha Anyway, my first experience required no waiting time. I think I hit it just before the crowd. Thank God. All I remember was....it was the most amazing ramen that has ever entered my mouth. NO JOKE. We ordered the spicy tuna on rice and the spicy char-siu pork ramen. Both were great! The place was kinda uncomfortable to sit in and only can fit about 20 people at most, but we were basically the only customers then so it wasn't a problem. The second time I went. A line....damn..but well worth it for such a delish bowl of ramen!! Ordered the same things as I rarely get the chance to come to this place. The only thing that made me take off a star is that because the place was so small and I was carrying a big purse, there wasn't a good spot for me to put it other than between my legs or on my lap. I was almost done eating, but my bag had slipped and I had to get up from my seat and pick it up. okay. I got yelled at by the girl that worked there. She said something along the lines of ""MISS YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN"". I was literally like O.O..alright there...calm down...Everything was delicious as usual, but this girl really pissed me off. What was I supposed to do? Leave my bag for you and everyone else to trip on and trample on?? -_- i don't think so. But other than her, 4/5 - Great food! Maybe not so great service. But whatevs. Not even that big of a deal since I won't be seeing her anytime soon."
4,-1,been here a few times - perfect for a small group 2-6 ppl. get the balcony seating. best pork empanadas. and they mix a fine spanish manhattan.
4,-1,I really had a nice time in this place..really a nice ambience..Shell crabs were amazing...really enjoyed it!
1,-1,"My wife and I visited Carmines whilst on vacation in Manhattan last week. I made a booking early in the day for 10pm that night. We arrived at 9:50 and were told there was no booking for us (even though full details were taken at the time of booking). They told us to take a seat at the bar and they ""might"" get to us in 30 mins. We paid $26.00 for two cheap glasses of wine at the bar and waited 45 mins to be called. The waiter was extremely impatient and did not take any time to explain anything to do with the menu. He rolled his eyes when we asked him about certain dishes. He didn't offer desert, we had to ask him. When we received the bill there was 18% tips already added. (which i paid) When i handed the cash to the waiter he just said ""Bye"". I'm giving a 1 star because ??the food just ok. The food was ok but the staff took away from the whole experience. We visited Carmines as it was recommended by a number of friends who had visited New York. it was a very poor experience and I would never recommend Carmines to any of my friends"
4,1,"Sweet staff, good food."
5,-1,I love their food. I 1st was introduced to them from their food truck on 20th St & 5th Ave. Now I am working near Spring Street and I'm still hooked! I get the falafel sandwich with everything on it & like it with more spiciness. I love the Pear smooth too. So refreshing!
4,1,"We were taking a stroll by the museum and found this place on yelp. ??Fantastic. ??I strongly recommend you check out the back patio, you almost feel like you've escaped the city. ??But the design of the place inside is pretty cool; it feels like a fun version of the David Bowie movie labyrinth. ??I was very surprised and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I withhold 1 star for two reasons. ??My fellow dinners pizza got very burnt on the outside crust and they were a little skimpy on the toppings."
5,1,"Delish!! Having said that, this place is really fantastic. I went here with my boyfriend and 3 other peeps last night. We shared some appetizers: crabcake, duck romoulade, artichoke stew, cabbage slaw salad, and all of these were great, except the crabcake was not equipt with enough bites! ??I wanted another one; but definately won't share next time... it was a little bite of fresh, creamy crab meat in a delicately breaded meatball. ??For my main, I had the pancetta wrapped monkfish, it was terrif! ??3 chunks of tender lobster tail-like flesh coated in salted pork over a bed of mashed potatos with a crown of sweet braised red cabbage. The sauce was sweet and savory, like a cherry-plus-wine glaze sauce. My boyf had the chicken and it was delish as well, crispy skin and tender in the middle in a savory buttery sauce. ??A friend had the hanger steak, served rare, looked amazing but I didn't taste it. ??He even took the rest home! ??Dessert was steamed lemon cake (sooo good) and donuts and icecream. The donuts were hot and the icecream was a good, standard vanilla. The lemon cake was superb. ??If you can imagine the texture of cake mixed with creamy custard with the flavor of high quality lemon curd...with fresh berries and whipped cream---excellent. The decor and atmosphere is casual and non-pretentious, service was impeccible (even after we payed the bill, the waitstaff kept our water glasses filled to the brim while we sat). ??And the cocktails are ??great, try the tequila cocktail if you love sweet cocktails. Homemade triplesec!! Overall, a fantastic experience!!"
5,-1,"The drinks here are the best part. ??The margaritas are amazing, and the food is out of this world. ??Don't go into Barrio Chinos expecting not to taste the guacomole, its the best ever!! ??Its really that good, so its a good place to get drunk and then have great tasting munchie food!"
5,1,"First & foremost the staff is 100% nice & friendly. I have never gotten a dirty look when getting extra sauce or anything from the condiment stand. Best Mexican food in New York, hands down. The steak is very juicy and flavorful, keep up the great work homemade taqueria!!"
3,1,I think this is a safe spot to go if you have friends coming from out of town or you have a big group that has many varying tastes. This place serves delicious Italian food that will satisfy pretty much anyone. I wouldn't say anything is exceptional but the lobster mac & cheese was good. The Pappardelle with Braised Oxtail Ragu was also tasty. I would come again but probably not my go-to.
4,-1,"It will depend on what you get. I got the egg and chicken roll which was great but my husband got the kebab roll which is a definite no no. Cute pictures on the wall depicting the menu and old indian movie posters. Small seating area, kind of hot to sit inside the summers (even tho have ac) but not bad. Don't go for a main meal - use as a place to snack and go and you will not be disappointed. Prices are great ! 20 bucks for 2 people -can't be beat."
5,1,"This place is amazing! Very classy restaurant with reasonable prices. The view and architecture are amazing. The menus are lighted up which is a big plus in a restaurant. Had the lobster mac and cheese and churrasco. Both were delicious. Drinks are great not watered down. But with what I was most pleased is the service. Very attentive and on point. Our server, Tatiana, was wonderful. Very accommodating. Any issues she took care of as well as the manager making sure his guests are happy. Never had a glass empty, missing utensils or waiting too long for food. I absolutely love this place!"
5,-1,"I have been meaning to write my praise for this place for awhile now, but did not have time until now. ??My partner and I usually go to New York every year to go shop, watch broadway shows and try the best restaurants that we have heard about. ??This ramen place surely deivered on being the best. The broth of the ramen I ordered was amazing. ??The texture and taste solidifies the fact that these noodles are handmade fresh. We were going to see Daniel Radcliffe in How to Suceed in business... that night and I was so disappointed that when the waiteress offered a refill on my noodles I had to say no since we were running late. The next time we go to New York this definitely will be a ""MUST""."
5,-1,"This is a great spot - cocktails, funky atmosphere, eclectic, accessible music, great food, service staff were friendly and attentive and for real...chat with the guy in the hat at the front door - he runs the events there. Coolness with a welcoming hug...and yes, the shrimp toast is amazeballs!"
5,1,"The food here is superb and ingredients are very fresh. We came here for dinner during the week and it was not too crowded. We all got different mains: duck breast, lamb chops, steak, and fish. They were all amazing choices. I love the potato here... the food does have French influence. Would definitely come back to try brunch!"
5,-1,"We love MOB, a restaurant ??serving healthful food without compromising on taste, or on ambiance - this place is fun-ky. ??The prices are reasonable, the servers are so friendly and nice, and we are all about the local/organic bit (but this is Brooklyn, so - DUH). ??We were regulars as soon as we walked in, and we bet you will be, too. ??See you at MOB!"
1,-1,"the kind of place that entrances you for the first couple visits until you realize dealing with bemused twenty-something waiters with bigger things on their minds than prompt service isn't all that great. (a few of the female waitresses are actually pleasant, refreshing.) roberta's boasts a seeming inability to keep up with a high volume of orders. even in a takeout situation, i've been left waiting for twenty minutes after i was told to arrive. the situation isn't help by the dour faced owner manning the oven who looks eternally troubled by something, though it certainly can't be the confounding logistics of running a pizza joint. that being said, the pizza's quite good. still, roberta's is one of the only places close to where i live and the deplorable service was enough for me to swear the place off."
3,-1,bring back nutella cookies and olive oil cake
4,1,"Loved it. Great food (Tuna Tartar, Lamb chops and Spicy Shrimp) and the owner was a terrific host, making us feel immediately at home, chatting and making recommendations. The prices were really reasonable too, especially when you only pay $15 for a good bottle of wine (BYOB). Only con was the wait. It's a very small restaurant, so we had to wait for a table despite making a ""reservation."" Definitely worth it, but if you aren't a patient person, find a bigger place."
3,1,Just wanted a quick bite to eat.we originally wanted to seat outside but as we waited 10 mns to get our drinks we migrate inside....lol..Garvy our waiter was cool n on point after he bought us our drinks..aka the crab cakes came before the drinks..thats was a laughter for us..but 1st time here was nice we will definitely be back and try the rest of their menu.ps: tnat5 honey glaze chicken was nice and soft until I got to the half way it got dry to the point my mouth was smacking like I was eating peanut butter. So laterz peaches! ;)
2,1,This place is okay. I gave them two stars because they have a lot of flies and my noodles came out burnt. Wish I had a better meal
4,1,"Excellent Fish! Well prepared and seasoned with just the right amount of mashed and veggies as accompaniment . Loved the garlic infused oil and bread as well as the salad to start. ??My girlfriend ??had the Branzino--loved it and I had a meaty piece of Stripped Bass, now my new favorite fish. ??Great healthy flavorful meal, cant wait to return. ?? Would have given 5 stars but for the waiter we had. He was deadpan and lackluster while the other waiters were engaging and informative. Not even a thank you when leaving just a stoic good night."
3,1,"the service was exceptional, the food was just okay for me. ??We had lots of dishes, the charcuterie - the rabbit confit was the best dish of the night, duck liver was a total miss the raw cow cheese was good - but they don't really make that. ??The tartines are a bit disappointing too much bread - we had 3 of them and none were remarkable. ??Steak tartar was under seasoned and when we asked for salt were provided with table salt - I'd expect something a little better. ??Lamb shank was nothing special, so overall I wouldn't really recommend it, especially when there are so many great french restaurants in the city."
4,-1,"We like it here a lot. Good food, pleasant atmosphere and good service."
4,1,"Beautifully decorated space, but wow, they really cram people in here. I definitely eavesdropped on the conversations of an older man/younger guy gay couple on a date. ?? The food was great. The bread was so good. I had to stop myself so that I could save room for my meal. We started with the English Pea Risotto. Delicious! My fiance had the Duck Confit and I had Roasted Chicken. The duck was moist and prepared well but probably would have been too heavy for me to finish. The couple bites I stole off his plate packed a huge punch of flavor. My chicken dish was a pleasant surprise; it was the juiciest chicken breast I have ever eaten in my life. We also split a side of pomme frites because it was on ""Best thing I ever ate."" Verdict? It was not the best thing I ever ate. Overall, great food and good service. Could be a problem if you're claustrophobic though."
2,-1,"This review is regarding service -- not the food as I didn't acutally get a chance to eat there. ??My fiance and I were meeting someone there for brunch, we checked in and waited as you aren't allowed to be seated until your whole party has arrived (fine). ??Due to a miscommunication, our other party wasn't going to be able to join us so we changed our party size to 2 and sat down. ??We ordered, service was slow, but fine. ?? About half an hour later, we still hadn't received our food, our extra guest shows up unexpectedly. ??We grabbed another chair from a table that wasn't using it and sat down. ??We were fine and not blocking anyone. ??A few min later (as the waitress was pouring coffee for the third guest) the hostess runs up and say we cannot sit there like this. ??So I say fine, apologize profusely, and ask if we can be moved. ??She says no, as there are other people on the list ahead of us. ??I am flabbergasted -- other people on the list ahead of us? I am already sitting, we have already ordered! ??So as the food is getting to the table, (the poor food runner was so confused) she tells us we HAVE to leave, so I say fine, we put down $10 for the terrible coffee we kind of drank and leave. ??As we are leaving, she asks if we want our food to go?!!! Seriously?! ?? I understand that we were annoying, but talk about terrible customer service, not only did they loose on the cost of food, (they had already made it and it was coming to our table as she gave us the boot) but to offend a customer and made a scene in front of the whole restuarant. ??The fact that they had an empty table for 4 and would not seat us there, as our food was coming out of the kitchen, to me, is astonishing. ?? Also, my fiance is the chef of a very popular restuarant down the block. ??I understand restaurants have rules, but sometimes, a little flexibility isn't a bad thing. ??I will not be back."
1,-1,"A friend and I visited this restaurant last night. We found it very disappointing. We ordered their mixed grill, fries and borak. The borak was greasy and minuscule. The bread was lovely - the parts that were not burnt black. The salad must have been at least two days old. The grilled tomatoe was bravely turned upwards was burnt black underneath. Not a recommended restaurant"
2,-1,"they used to so good but not anymore! where is the best sushi in the city? no azabu, no 15east...."
5,-1,"I need to go back here again!! The mussels were delicious and I kept dipping my toasted bread in their broth. Their pizzas were the bombdiggity, and I heard their sausage was delicious. Also, that first bite of the baby jesus cake......... that was some damn good cake!"
5,-1,"I am almost at a loss of words to describe how utterly amazing and memorable my meal was at EMP. From start to finish we felt pampered by the incredible staff and were blown away by the creativity and whimsical nature of the menu - the food told a story about New York's history and the vast majority of the courses tasted at least as good as they looked (the only misses for me were likely due to personal likes/dislikes rather than to anything being wrong with the cuisine). EMP now has a single tasting menu for $195, approximately fifteen courses and is exactly the same at lunch and dinner; expect the meal to last approximately three and a half hours. ??I never thought I would say this about a meal in this price range, but it actually is a bargain for what you receive! EMP is located across the street from Madison Park in the Credit Suisse building. You walk in to a large open dining room with massive ceilings and there is instantaneously an elegant vibe. Tables for two are quite large and roomy and seating comfortable; there is very pleasant and tasty modern decor. The view out the windows of Madison Park reminded my wife and I bit of the pleasant ambiance and view in one of our favorite Chicago restaurants, North Pond, but the cuisine and experience was very similar to my favorite restaurant, Alinea (of which EMP is in the midst of doing a collaborative project). The main difference between the two venues is Alinea has more of a modernist focus where each dish has a theatrical presentation and EMP strikes a balance between playful and serious courses. From the moment you are seated at EMP you are treated royally, but the servers despite being so polished are incredibly friendly, chatty and down to Earth - by the end of the meal you feel like you have developed a friendship with them. One aspect of EMP that I love is that even though it is a tasting menu, they want you to be comfortable with your food and encourage you to state not just any allergies you have, but any dislikes or aversions you have. They listen to this in earnest and flawlessly accommodate all reasonable requests making great tasting substitutions without detracting from the presentation. This makes experiencing EMP approachable for a finicky eater who appreciates high end cuisine, but is nervous about tasting menus. Interesting side note, we asked what the oddest request our server has received and he indicated that one diner claimed to have a salt allergy! The first several courses are a series of Amuse Bouches and all were excellent with my favorites being a play on the classic Black & White cookie (this one was served in a gift box and was savory with Parmesan and black truffle) and a Cucumber snow dish. There are also some shared courses (my favorite being carrot tartare that is prepared in a meat grinder tableside and accompanied by a fun tray with all sorts of fixings so you can doctor it up to your liking) .There are also four courses where you choose the main ingredient (you can either be surprised by the preparation or ask for a description before ordering). Prior to the desserts there is an extremely fun cheese course delivered in a picnic basket; along with the cheese is a pretzel and a really tasty beer made special for EMP. At the start of dessert your server rolls a cart tableside and whips up the best egg cream imaginable. ??Then come the desserts followed by mignardises served with a magic trick as well as some apple brandy and finally some parting goodies to take home. Unlike some of New York's other top notch venues, EMP has really reasonably priced adult beverages. They have a wonderful cocktail list (with most costing $15), my favorite was the Manhattans - they have several varieties and the bartender rolls up a special cart tableside and creates it in front of you. There is a vast wine list with mostly expensive choices, but there are some under $100 and most of the wines by the glass run just under $20. We had the privilege of receiving a kitchen tour as a little intermission before the dessert courses. While inside the kitchen we were treated to the most amazing gin based cocktail made with pop rocks and frozen with liquid nitrogen; this rivaled any cocktail I have consumed at my favorite lounge (The Aviary in Chicago) and was such a treat to drink this inside the kitchen. My wife and I were truly touched by how well we were treated at a restaurant we were dining at for our first time. This was more than just a phenomenal meal but an amazing, unforgettable experience. This ranks as the second best meal I have ever had (with Alinea being number one) and came extremely close to supplanting Alinea for my number one spot. EMP is truly a destination restaurant and an absolute must for dining enthusiasts. A big thank you EMP for being the highlight of a great vacation; I will definitely be back next time I am in New York and will be returning to New York sooner than I had anticipated just to experience EMP again."
3,-1,"Noodle Soup was ok but ??still have the MSG after taste, soup dumpling not meet the standard."
3,1,This place is cool to go once just to see what the fuss is about but I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there twice. Bacon in everything is a bit much. I had the chicken bacon club which was kind of good except for the really wet bread on the bottom which I couldn't eat as a result. My friend got the BLT and it was nothing special - there wasn't really that much bacon in it but it was bread overload. The service was good though - waitress kept stopping by to make sure we had everything we need which was nice.
5,-1,"Excellent dinner. Waiter, Ken, was very knowledgeable and took great care of us. Were celebrating our anniv and when the chef learned this, he sent over a comp dessert. Every dish was outstanding but the Caramel Sundae was heavenly! Will definitely return."
5,-1,"Heard so much about Momofuku and it lived up to its reputation. We were lucky and were seated right away at the bar. The place was packed to the gills with hip music blaring throughout the restaurant. We had excellent oysters, steamed pork buns, expertly grilled octopus, and spicy pork sausage & rice cakes. The service was friendly and efficient."
4,-1,"Consistently good food and service. The Good Fork is a great place for local, seasonal food with a creative spin. My personal favorite is the roasted brussel sprout salad...yum!"
2,-1,"I went to totto 2 days ago and had been waiting outside for an hour, even if there is outdoor heater but it wasn't help at all. My fingers and feet were dead. Anyway, I don't mind for the long wait if the ramen is very delicious. ??I ordered totto extra spicy ramen and my friend order niku ramen. The taste was just ok, not outstanding. Just like other ramen restaurants. Plus, the thing that made me very disappointed was the totto extra spicy ramen wasn't spicy for me at all. Then I asked for more sesame oil but they charged me $1.25 for a very tiny cup. I think 50 cents is reasonable , $1 is ok but $1.25 is unacceptable!!! I can eat spicy and the menu indicates that this ramen is very spicy( with 9 chilies). I went to Thai restaurant they gave me hot sauce with no charge. By the way, the service was nice. But the ramen wasn't worth the wait at all"
5,-1,Two words...AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!
4,-1,pizza was good but to be honest the plain the better i felt sometimes too much is too much for instance i dont like cherries on my pizza or limoncello on my pizza... other than that delicious!
2,-1,"This place needs some work. Quite generic in everything they offer, but then again, prices are low. I may have ordered the wrong things. Don't eat grilled chicken here... it will be very... very dry. You'd probably safe with hummus or other simple things. I was disappointed but it's clearly a very popular spot. I imagine nothing is truly made from scratch."
4,1,"If you order the Mac & cheese small plate ??it tastes good but beware it will be enough food for one as it is. It's a large portion, very filling The lamb meatballs are delicious, and very satisfying. You have to try these. Both sliders, the angus w/ blue cheese and the shortribs sliders. I have to tell you though, choose the shortribs slider - it melts in your mouth, and leaves you begging for more. A perfect close out to your ""destined to be memorable"" meal is the Limoncello dessert - try it, trust me, you'll be glad you didn't leave without it. Jack & Nellie's is a Forest Hills dream come true; if we can get them on Grubhub they will crush the competition."
4,1,"The bar is cool with lots of character, in a gas punk kind of way. I believe this was a former bike shop. The beer taps come from bike equipment left over from the former bike shop. My brother found this gem whilst walking from his part of Williamsburg to my area. The food is good and the atmosphere is even better. We came here for a Sunday brunch this winter. There was a jazz trio playing and the vibe was quite cool. If you want to stop in for a fast one, or, enjoy a hearty meal then saddle up to the bar. I enjoyed the intimate space and great lighting."
4,1,"Right off the bat, I was inclined to dislike Risotteria. 1. They serve primarily risotto, unsurprisingly. 2. They appeal heavily to a Gluten-Free audience. I happen to be: 1. An Asian who dislikes rice. [gasps go here] 2. A girl who loves her some gluten. Carbs, sauces, yesss. ?? You see how this did not seem like a match made in heaven? Well, I came here for dinner with my Gluten-Free (Celiac's, not by choice) roommate and her family. I didn't know much about gluten-free foods before this, since we basically narrowed down our shared foods to chocolate, frosting, and more chocolate. We split a Pesto Pizza, customized to have shrimp and spinach on top, and a Chicken, Pine nuts, and Porcini Risotto. For a non-risotto-lover like me, I nevertheless found it pretty tasty. The portions are not skimpy here, even when it came to the salad and soup that the rest of our party ordered. Plus I'm sure we ate our worth in GF breadsticks. Ultimately, I give the 4th star because it was nice being able to share a meal with her, since GF is still relatively scarce on the NYC food scene. It's pretty cool to see someone's eyes light up when they get all excited about having a /choice/ of stuff on the menu, a right that we often take for granted. In any case, the Celiac's Seal of Approval toothpick flag that came on our pizza adorns the fridge as a reminder to go back soon. Until then, it's Chocolate time!"
4,1,"Dinner was fantastic and dining in such a significant historic location is inspiring to me. I decided to have app-inner tonight and enjoyed the soup du jour (lobster bisque - thinner than many bisques I've had but more actual lobster), the salmon salad (capers, diced red onions, boiled egg, & salmon over mixed greens salad), and the mushroom Brie toast (definitely must have!!). I decided to have a signature cocktail and ordered the Chamomile Whisky Sour but they are currently out of the House-infused Chamomile Irish Whisky. My server knowledgeably suggested another option - The Dubliner (Jameson Black Barrel, Grand Marnier, Sweet Vermouth & Orange Bitters) which was delicious. In fact, everything was delicious. The only reason it's not a 5 star is that I had an odd shift back & forth between a couple different servers and it wasn't quite the signature experience that could be delivered with all the plusses this restaurant has on its side. All in all, I definitely recommend a visit."
3,-1,Recently changed chefs. Would have given it 5 stars previously for the food. Previously had what was possibly THE BEST fish & chips in the whole of NYC and wonderful foie gras mousse. Very sad that the dishes have now changed and are cooked in a different style by a different chef. Food is okay now--was excellent before this. It was a neighbor gem so I feel really sad about the chef change!
5,1,"I first got hip to this neighborhood treasure one year ago. I fell in love with the food, decor, and vibe. I'm proud to say that over this past year i've become a full convert and feel close this restaurant and it's staff. The service is amazing, and the staff really gets to know and care about their regulars. This aspect, the hospitality and kindness, is thanks to the show runner, Giulia. Simply put, This lady is amazing! She's the heart. There's a reason the clientele and staff respect her immensely. ?? ?? ??And i haven't even mentioned the food. I'm partial to Brunch at Aita and i wholly recommend the Salmon Hash, a sophisticated take on an old favorite. They do the classics right too, but the Salmon Hash is a standout. Ditto for the Oxtail Burger. Absolutely you should try it, it's original and addicting. ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? Simply put, I can not recommend this place enough. It's got the cozy in-the-know kind of vibe which has been slowly disappearing from the restaurant scene in New York. On any given brunch, you can spot young couples next to older Italians next to a few celebrity regulars sipping a (magnificent) B Mary and enjoying a meal without pretension. ?? ??And that brunch bartender, whoever he is, plays some great music. ?? ??Bravo. Try it."
4,-1,"expensive, but fantastic. ??I sat at the bar and had a great meal. ??Highlights were the ""comfort"" elements: Stromboli in the bread basket (still warm) and the fried mozzarella app that had was an uppity way to relive the mozzarella marinara of my early high school suburban youth."
3,1,"Very busy brunch spot that is perfect for a lazy Sunday morning. Food and drinks are decent. I tried the huevos rancheros after reading reviews on yelp, and it definitely did not disappoint. If you sit outside on a hot sunny day, be careful where they seat you --- the umbrellas don't do a good job covering the entire patio area, and if you're unlucky enough to have to sit in the sun you'll be roasted by the end of your brunch!"
4,1,"Had good ambience, food was very unique then have its like anywhere else. The fried chicken I had was very moist and season well. Pretty pricey, but you could tell the price is based on the quality of the food. The service was good overall. No meal. We went for brunch and there wasn't many people in there, at least not in our section. Very satisfied with the service and I definitely will go back one day."
3,1,"I think I'll stick to dinner at LV, because brunch was a little off. ??Most of the food was tasty - the pastries were nice, and the ricotta was stellar - but it didn't have the ""punch"" of the items I'd previously enjoyed. ??Plus, our server was so obviously hung over that getting milk for coffee or our check or a fork was as difficult as getting legislation passed. ??I'll definitely be back, but maybe not in the AM..."
5,1,"hole in the wall gem that i'm SO glad I found while all the other tourists were waiting an hour and a half at a regular old brunch place. the tiny restaurant is just one long bar. ??when you wait, the only room is directly behind the diners sitting at the bar. ??When we came at about 12pm on a Thursday, the place was completely full but it cleared up pretty quickly and we only waited about 10-15 minutes. ??You can tell it's a great establishment when every diner there was a regular and said goodbye to the owner by his first name, Robert? I think? The cooks are super efficient in taking your order. ??They have the tough Ukranian/Polish vibe where they all wear white shirts and aprons, but are Super sweet to the diners and provide great service. We got 2 eggs and corned beef hash and the kielbasy omlette with breakfast potatoes each with a side of challah bread. Def good rib-sticking hangover food, healthy portions... will need to return for the pierogi and borscht."
4,1,"What a great place for brunch. ??As a Manhattanite, spending less than $20 bucks on a large brunch is a deal especially when you ordered 2 appetizers including table-side gauc and an entree, 4 entrees, two drinks, and lots of sides. ??What a steal!"
5,1,The hands down best Sushi in the city (not the world though :)) Prepare to part with your money and get small portions of sushi (it's how it should be). Bigger is not better. I try to make it here for a once a year sushi-geddon. Some of the freshest fish and I even got to try the fabled pufferfish here.
5,1,"Great wine, great food, great dessert, and a great atmosphere. They have a wine expert that helps you pick out a bottle you are looking for. Their lamb meatballs are highly recommended, they were so delicious. A really great restaurant."
5,-1,"I've tried half a dozen different arepas and they all have been great. Whatever sauce they leave out on the table is awesome! No idea what it is, but I put it on everything!"
4,1,"really good fries, but what makes them exceptional are the creamy sauces one can personalize! i thought that the fries would be the shoe string ones like in Belgium, but these are pretty good!"
5,1,Came in for a double short espresso. ??Loved it!!!! ??Great smooth no bitter after-taste Highly recommend
5,-1,"Whether you're sitting at the bar, or at one of their tables the service at this place is excellent! FYI: if your plan is to go for a table, make sure you have a reservation otherwise good luck! The bar has a wide selection of wines so coming here to sip on some wine or sexy cocktail after work is always fun. Food: SCRUMPTIOUS!!! No matter what you pick in the menu. I'm not too much into Risotto, but their lobster risotto with black truffle is phenomenal! You must try it-at least once. It'll take you to heaven! On a lower scale note: Best. Fries. Ever! These lithe, perfectly golden and crispy potatoes are the perfect thing to pair a drink with at the bar."
4,1,"I discovered Cheryl's on Yelp and I agree with most of the reviewers - it's a great brunch spot. The brunch pre-fixe includes a mimosa or bloody mary, coffee or tea, and entree. The coffee is strong and the food comes out very quickly, which is great. I've had the poached eggs with salmon hash and I've also tried some of their soup specials and salads. Everything has been excellent. If you are going on a Saturday or Sunday, be prepared to wait 15 minutes or so for a table (maybe longer depending on what time you go). The restaurant itself is pretty small so there is usually a little bit of a wait, but nothing like the wait at Tom's a few blocks away. One tip to be aware of - the hot sauce comes out EXTREMELY fast, and all of the pourers are the same, so be careful..."
3,1,"Momofuku Ssam Bar was the first Momofuku(david chang) establishment I've been too. I found it good, but not great, though I'll probably check out the rest of David Chang's empire at some point. The Ssam bar is a heaven of meat dishes, ranging from the raw, to the fish, and to the bo ssam(basically a whole butt). I did like the ambiance of the place, since it was very casual and laid back; though it was dark, I appreciated how popular the place was(I came at 9:30 and people kept pouring in.) Since it was sort of a late meal, and because I planning on hitting up the milk bar across the street with a friend, I only ordered the spicy pork sausage with rice cakes, essentially David Chang's re imagining of Ddukboki.(I regret not getting the pork buns, since those are heavily hyped, but I'm sure I will the next time I come). Though the portion wasn't very large, the sausage and the rice cakes were alright. It doesn't look very ""korean"", though I did ask for extra heat on mine, so it was pretty spicy. The sausage wasn't what i expected, since it was cut into such small pieces with the thick sauce I could have imagined it as a pasta sauce. I also sampled my friend's shanghai noodle, which was much more delicate, perhaps less comfort food and more of something original. Anyhow, I think this is an incomplete review of a popular restaurant, and I'm sure I'll be back. Also, remember that they don't take reservations unless you go for the Bo Ssam."
5,-1,very nice place
5,1,"Delish! Pasta was amazing, great service! Large family portions, if they say it's for two it's really ??big enough for four."
4,1,"Fantastic service, a very satisfying menu, and just a really nice experience overall. I suspect complaints about ""blandness"" in the food comes from the prep, which is pretty restrained and in keeping with the locally-sourced vibe of the place. Worth seeking out; make a short walk of the High Line and end up at the 20th St. stairway... you'll be glad you discovered this cousin to 100 Acres (great brunch spot in outer SOHO). Marred slightly by the road noise of 10th Ave. Even during dinner, it can be a bit noisy and annoying when the windows are open. Can't fault the place much for that, but it's something to be aware of."
5,-1,"I've eaten at The Pines several times and it keeps getting better and better. I gave a four star review very soon after they opened citing focus and service as two things that prevented me from giving five stars, which I do not do lightly. At this point, Angelo has really hit his stride. His food is so creative, inspired and downright delicious that I believe he will be recognized as a truly great chef. All of the kinks have been ironed out on the service and, now with the back yard in full swing, I'd give six stars if I could."
4,-1,"Good service! I enjoyed the Crawfish & Shrimp, still love HOT & JUICY CRAWFISH THE BEST! I also enjoyed their cocktails very much! I would love to come here everyday.... but I fear obesity."
5,1,"Let me tell you, this people know how to make a steak! I think they are much better than Peter Luger, and way less expensive. I got the butchers steak with garlic butter and it was amazing! Really big chunk of meat cooked perfectly. Just one thing before you come, be prepared to wait the long line (you can seat at their bar next door and enjoy a bottle of wine outdors) Overall I'm very satisfied with this place."
4,-1,"Classic American food done to perfection in a low key but nice atmosphere. ??This place is perfect for a small brunch, business lunch or get together with friends. ??The food is far better than you will find at most of the neighboring establishments and it is rarely so packed you can't get a seat. ??The portion sizes are also perfectly sized to satisfy you but not encourage you to eat so much you bust a gut. ??There is a menu online but some items are seasonal so you won't find everything there every time which is a real bummer for me b/c I so wanted crab cakes Bennedict last weekend for brunch and Maryland Blue Crabs are out of season."
5,-1,"Cute decor, cute desserts, cute drinks! Cha-An isn't a place for real food, but they offer so many delicious Japanese styled desserts and teas. It's a small little tea house tucked away in the East Village, and is complete with a tea garden, attentive tea servers and Earl Grey Chocolate Mochi!"
5,-1,A real roadhouse in NYC complete with a screen door and a jumping jukebox. Specializing in Cajun/southern ??food. their burgers are hands down the best. This is the real deal when it comes to eating homestyle food nothing shakey fakey about it! After I eat a meal here I want to hug the cook.
5,1,"Had a truly delicious meal here on a wintry Saturday night. We came with four people with a reservation. When we had to wait 5 minutes, the hostess was incredibly apologetic. We ended up being seated next door at Taureau, which was fine by us. Both places have a cozy atmosphere, and we ended up sitting leisurely for over 3 hours with our BYOB wine!! The food was great, and here is what we liked the best: - goat cheese tartine: would have licked the plate clean if I could have. We got THREE for the four of us, which felt like overkill, but it was that good and everyone wanted there own. - octopus salad- delicious, but not light like i had imagined - hangar steak- it had a pepper corn crust that i am still thinking about today. Easily my favorite entree - mussels in curry (chef fav)- not your run of the mill mussels. delicious flavoring and they even bring more bread so you can sop up the sauce - lamb- my husband doesnt even like lamb and he liked the way it tasted here Since we were seated at Taureau, we ended up doing chocolate fondue for dessert, which was a lot of fun."
3,1,"Really like the atmosphere, very friendly. Pizza is nice and light and the calzone rocks. The beer selection is pretty decent. I would like to go back."
3,1,"Good for brunch because they take reservations. I got my reserved table in 10 minutes while they told people without rezzies that it would be 45. WOO! Otherwise, though, while pretty tasty, this was nothing all that special. The huevos rancheros were decent and came in a huge baked dish that could've fed two. My friend's frittata was, again, huge, but only okay flavor-wise. And even though I love beet juice and fresh vegetables overall, I really didn't like their Left Coast Bloody Mary. It tasted like soap. (I'm not one of those people who think cilantro tastes like soap, but this tasted like I imagine cilantro tastes to people who hate cilantro.)"
5,-1,"We go here every year since it was one of our first date spots. This evening when we went, they brought us to the first table we ever sat in. As usual, we had a wonderful dinner, with great service, and refreshing healthy food - east coast oysters, spaghetti with heirloom tomatoes, grilled chicken. ??Everything was perfect, and when we mentioned that we recently got engaged, we received a wonderful surprise - a complimentary congratulations dessert with muscato. We both left feeling very fulfilled and look forward to many more wonderful dinners at Riverpark!"
4,1,The food and decor makes this place worth coming to again and again. We started with the flat bread then went with the fluke and shrimp entrees. Everything was good but we thought the fluke was more amazing than the other two dishes.
5,-1,Fabulous place for a quality dinner or lunch. I went to riverpark for restaurant week which is a great time to try a new place and get the most for your buck! Service was spectacular waiter we had was totally approachable and patient with a group of 9 of us. I had radiator pasta with pork sausage kale. salmon with some type of squash basil reduction thing and and peach sundae. Sorry for my amateur description as this was a few month ago and I dont remember the details. BUT I RECOMMEND 100%!
4,1,"Charming, unassuming and simply lovely dinner/drinking spot. ??The service was attentive. ??The apps (oysters, deviled eggs) - yummy. ??Drinks were fantastic -- in particular, the Cucumber Collins and the Admiral Martini (Plymouth Gin, orange bitters) topped the fave list. ??Will definitely go back to check out brunch or dinner. ??Another thing to take advantage of before the weather turns: ??An indoor-outdoor window ledge with bar seats. ??Genius!"
5,-1,"cassoulet. ??enough said. the creamiest white beans. ??Great service, enthusiastic chef owner, takes real joy in his customers satisfaction. He likes timely feedback, and the food deserves it. speak up, ask, he will make sure your meal is memorable. ?? and for me, the cassoulet was perfect. ??cc"
4,-1,"Had a party there several weeks ago in a small room upstairs for 20 people. ??We had to cater to a pepper allergy, kosher, muslim and vegetarian diets and teh staff at Ilili pulled it off without breaking a sweat. The food was fabulous and the service impeccable. ??Coordinating the party, the menu, drinks, etc. was effortless with their help and we cannot thank them enough. A must try..."
1,-1,"My husband and I ate at the Highlands Restaurt for Valentines and it was a very dissapointing night. The soup was completely tasteless and the mushroom dish I had as my main course was boring. Both our desserts were delightful, but that was the only good thing. The fact that neither me nor my husband drank any alcohol seemd to upset th waiter and the service was bad. We didn't get any extra bread (the table next to us were asked if they wanted more on multiple occations) and we had to wait for a very long time between the main course and the dessert. On top of this, the seating made my back hurt. I really couldn't wait to leave and will never ever go back."
3,1,"Wow they really know how to cram everyone in there! Service was good and the security guard up front who took names down was very funny, I just dont like spicy and my chicken and waffle was spicier than I thought. My friend got that English muffin entree and that was no way worth $16 since it was so basic. The prices are a bit steep for the basics of breakfast, but it's a nice southern atmosphere inside."
5,-1,"I have been to this restaurant many times and never had a bad experience...From the short ribs, to the specials, to the delicious hamburgers...Also an excellent brunch.Great staff, love this place!"
5,1,Fantastic food decor is great and service was awesome Jason is the man. Highly recommend this location and make sure you try their peppers and homemade garlic
4,1,"Solid 4 stars - all the pasta is fantastic, cooked to perfection and the wine list is great. I really have nothing to say, which is rare, so I'll just put this to bed. Go to this place, you'll be glad you did."
4,1,"Spicing up Brunch! Paprika is a delightful, inexpensive, cozy restaurant serving delicious food without the attitude and for half the cost. I shared a wonderful brunch with friends last Saturday which included the mushroom and fontina omelet and the green eggs with polenta and salsa crudo. Both dishes were beautifully plated and delicious. My one recommendation is to come at 12! The restaurant fills up quite quickly after that. For a more in-depth review visit my blog Hartley Confections: hartleyconfections.com/2?£á?"
1,-1,"Everyone raves about this place and since we live in the hood, figured it was high time to give it a shot. Definitely not what we were expecting! The service was terrible, there were only about 7 people in the restaurant when we got there, at approx 1pm on a Saturday, I was actually surprised that there wasn't a wait at that time of day on the weekend. Our waitress took forever to get to our table and continued wandering around filling other people's coffee's even though we were quite obviously ready to order. I ordered the rabbit confit omelette and my girlfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich. I took one bit of my omelette and wanted to spit it out, it was literally the worst omelette I've ever tasted, not to mention that it was cold. I sent my plate back and the waitress seemed to not be surprised or care that the food wasn't good. No manager was sent over and she waited 15 minutes before returning to see if I wanted to order something else. By that time my girlfriend was finished with her sandwich. I wasn't even offered so much as a comp for my coffee! The pulled pork sandwich was OK, but definitely not anything special and was also luke warm at best. We also ordered a side of bacon, which was pretty good. Our waitress asked if I wanted anything else but I passed, she informed me that ""my breakfast would be taken off the bill,"" duh. Don't waste your money here, the prices are extremely high even if the brunch was outstanding, which it is not."
2,1,"Urrgh. If I wanted chain restaurants I'd go to New Jersey. Plus, it's overpriced and service is patchy at best. One waitress tried to convince my colleague that a Manhattan is made of vermouth and champagne. Totally clueless, I say."
5,-1,"Best place in NYC.. Who's cares that there burger price has gone up?? Wow, it's now $7:95!! Newsflash, it's NYC. Beer and a burger 4 less than $13 is a great deal in this day&age.. I love everything about the place.. Staff are grumpy-ish, great! ??Burger is by far the best in town.."
4,-1,"Their food is excellent. I got the pork + rice/beans/plantains a couple times and it was solid. I most of all enjoy just the rice/beans/plantains for less than $5, it's huge. While I worked in the DUMBO area I made a solid lunch of that once a week. Very nice fellas who work there, too. FYI: it's very casual inside."
5,1,Amazing!! Very good food great service!! We were in New York City for 10 days and never had better food. The owner was amazing and very gracious. Thank you for an evening well spent! Too bad you can only give this place five stars....
5,-1,Really Love what Chef Kelvins doing over here. Went in with @veronicachan for a business lunch and really enjoyed the pre-fixe. Portions are great as was service at the bar. A must go! (PS: The burger was really good as well as the desserts!)
4,1,"A friend turned me on to Jack and Nellie's for a mid-week Happy Hour dinner-and-drinks combo. While tucked away from the bustle of Austin street, the location was not too far off from main routes of public transportation, and would make a great stop after a shopping trip in the area. They were relatively quiet early in the evening, but ended the night with a great turnout for a weeknight. The wine specials for happy hour were tasty and reasonably priced and the food was good for snacking and sharing. We ordered the charcuterie board, which was well-balanced and more generously portioned than other places I've visited. Between the jam, grapes, mustard, duck pate, and sheep cheese, we couldn't decide what we liked best and kept coming back for more. Following the board with some brussel sprouts and bacon, we were in love with the flavors and enjoyed the comforting taste of the dish without feeling too weighed down or greasy. Finally, tempted by the desserts on the chalkboard, we indulged in a slice of chocolate mousse cake. All in all, I'm very pleased with my first visit to Jack and Nellie's and can definitely see myself returning to try their brunch menu."
4,1,"Got here at 6 pm on a Friday and there was already a 1.5 hour wait. We put our name and number down on long list of patrons. When we came back an hour later, we a sign ??posted on the door, the doors were locked, staff huddled in a meeting, and angry customers just sitting and waiting. We asked the crowd waiting outside what happened. Apparently, the chef stopped serving because he didn't like the broth. So they stopped service for an hour.. We stuck around for another 15 minute and they must've fixed their issues. After finally being seated at 8, we got a chance to order. We were starving. At least they were nice enough to give us a free order of edamame. We ordered the following: U&I - delicious but small portion for the $15 price tag. You get two tiny pieces of uni on top of roe and rice. Deep fried chicken wings stuffed with foie gras - the wings were delicious but the sauce was funky. A little too sour and overpowering. I think a spicy mayo might go better Spicy miso ramen - loved the broth but I hated the noodles. They were thick and too hard. The noodles really made me dislike this dish Mu Ramen - I loved the noodles and flavor of the broth. I just wish the broth was a tiny bit thicker/creamier. Overall, I thought Mu Ramen was good but I don't think I will be coming back often. There are a lot better ramen spots over the bridge."
3,1,"Not a bad place at all. Good beer selection. Service wasn't the best though. Bartender sort of ignored me (there was no one else at the bar ordering drinks and it was really quiet) and was a little snobby when I finally got her attention. I think she was having a bad day or something! The indoors is definitely 'narrow' but the backyard is really nice. Also, they barely have signage, so it's easy to miss this place."
2,1,"Went there before catching a performance of King Lear at Central Park with my wife. Having been there years ago at their old location, I expected good food and good service. It just happened to be Restaurant Week so it was also a good deal. Their bread, as I remembered was excellent! Ordered second helping of bread. And the Camarone appetizer was also very good. I asked if they could make their Ropa Vieja appetizer into an entree and they obliged without a problem. And then the entrees came. Wife opted for the Restaurant Wee pre-fixe menu and ordered some pork. It came out somewhat bland and slightly overcooked. The black bean that the meat was served on top of was very dense and mushy with consistency of mashed potatoes. I could tell that it had been cooked all day and you could no longer tell any hint of individual beans at all. Meat was kind of rubbery as pork tends to become when over-cooked. My beef stew was just way too salty. It also had signs of being cooked too long and was void of any liquid. Ropa Vieja is supposed to be cooked with some root vegetables like carrots and potatoes and usually come in lovely braising liquids and their version was just cooked too long and became very salty probably because it has been left heating in the pan evaporating all of its juices. My wife ate two bites of the pork and did not touch the rest. I managed to finish more than half of my entree with help of a lot of water due to saltiness. The dessert was ok but nothing special either. I know during Restaurant Weeks, places only serve a few pre-chosen items and prepare them in large quantities. But that doesn't mean that the quality should suffer. We walked away feeling that we paid too much for the quality of food. I felt that the place has gone down hill since they've moved to the new location which is a shame. Many restaurants are great in the beginning and keep their food quality control tight. After almost 20 years of being opened, this place has earned its place in the UWS, but I can't help thinking that they need to revisit their commitment to excellence as they were when they first opened.."
5,1,"I have to tell you...Probably the greatest, ""Tell"" of how great this restaurant is, is the location. ??It is this part of Manhattan where after matinee performances on Broadway or just before evening ones, diners flock given the proximity to the theatres. ??If I tell you there must be 75-100 restaurants within a 3 block radius, I'm sure I'm not off by that much. ??Most restaurants have people outside trying to recruit diners and as you walk by, most are empty. ??And then, you get to Becco. ??You go down 2 steps, through the first door and WHAM, traffic jam. ??After walking several blocks where you could hear a pin drop, all of a sudden, my friends and I couldn't even move because of how busy it is there. The all-you-can-eat pasta was amazing (I do think they should warn diners if any of them are spicy) and the Veal Parm was brilliant. ??I had never seen it served on the bone before. Any restaurant with Lidia associated with it makes me want to go but this happens to be one of the more affordable. Tourists visiting NYC, please take my advice...GO HERE! ??The service, the food...But make a reservation! ??I also got to meet the Executive Chef which was cool but Lidia's son (from Masterchef) was there and we JUST missed him. ??I'd give anything to meet him. ??Here's brilliant. Absolutely amazing!"
5,1,"This is a really great rebrand of an old Sushi joint. ??This Japanese style pub is a great addition the area. ??the food is excellent, perhaps too good for the very affordable cost. ??Zutto and it's owner and staff had a caring presence for a group of 9. ??If you are looking for a typical sushi place this is not it... If you want an experience Zutto will not only please, but seeks to exceed your expectation in food, drink and atmosphere. ??Great place for groups, the center wood table can seat 12 or more... very recommended. ??Most food venues in the area tend to be just that... menu, ambiance, but no life... The Chef at the NEW Zutto, is so intent on the experience of dining he puts the secret to his AMAZING Ramen right on the wall. ??This place is a great find."
5,1,"When people think of Cajun food I think if they get a bucket of crawfish with creole seasoning they are satisfied but there is SO much more. Sugar freak is a prime example of all the beautiful dishes that are the definition of cajun food. I recently moved to NY and as a foodie in a new city I don't ever want to go to a place too many times but I LOVE this place. I got their crawfish mac and cheese and it is always the perfect amount of cheesy goodness and crawfish together. I believe all of their mac and cheese's are perfect and come out in an iron skillet. I also had their sugar freak po boy. Which is fried chicken with mac and cheese on top. (Telling you.. Their mac and cheese has my heart) My friend got the crawfish ??touff??e. It was a little runny but it was piping hot. We ate some appetizers and once it set it was perfect. We also had boudin balls which were yummy too! If you never had boudin its a type of sausage, you can pick pork or crawfish here and we got the pork since our entrees were all crawfish. We also got beignets for dessert. YUM. Sad I didn't take a picture of them. I see powered sugar and I dive in. I feel like most people have this problem.. Right? Also, got speciality cocktails. Sugar Honey Iced Tea and Swamp juice. Adorable names! The swamp juice even had a gummy worm! We ordered too much food. The servings are huge(you can see in the pics). But we both missed Louisiana food much that we got carried away. AND to top it all off the service was friendly and knowledgable and the place itself is SO cute. The lights, tables, down to the mason jars. I love when its warm and they open the front of the store and you can see completely in. I'm in love with every aspect of this establishment. Please keep the good food comin'! I need to come out and try their brunch!"
1,-1,"I would like to start out with showing you guys a copy of my receipt along with the cold & dry food I was served with (check out pics)! My meal was very pricey for the amount of food provided; I spent $26 bucks on a take-out and not even supplied with napkins nor utensils! This is definitely not a place I would recommend nor re-visit; I feel bad for dragging my co-worker to this BBQ joint and she didn't even have enough money to pay for her take out! The spare ribs were good but too much bone, not enough meat, dry and COLD! They are charging the weight of the bone along w/ the meat which is awful. The mac n cheese was okay but I had better along w/ a better price; for $6 bucks the container had me ask the food server if he was sure I was given a medium SAD! The cornbread was rather heavy...perhaps it was b/c it tastes as thought it was soaked in butter! I could have made a box cornbread and it would have taste better I am completely surprised with the amount of good reviews this spot have accumulated!"
4,-1,Had late lunch here. ??Food was delish and Happy Hour Prosecco all you can drink! ??The meat and cheese board was fabulous and ??good prices. ?? Staff very friendly and attentive and great atmosphere.
4,1,"Chain food? Yes. ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??Ample seating? No GREAT HANGOVER FOOD! Since 1971, says the pic on the wall. Perfect NYU location for students on a budget. Can you really go wrong for $2.50 for a Falafel sammich? No. You get about 3 fried falafel (you can also order 3/$1) in your pita, topped with LT, tahini. Their falafel are very herby in flavor, which I like. Their Eggplant is nothing to scoff at either. Love the skin on that. Their hot sauce also has kick. It will trump any Vindaloo sauce. Not worth paying double for a platter. I'd rather have 2 sammiches. Must try the lamb schwarma next time. I haven't been to Taim's or Azuri Cafe yet, but this is up there w/ Alan's and Sam's. GO!"
5,1,"I LOVE this place. I've been looking for a good chinese restaurant since Chinatown Brasserie closed down, and I've finally found this. I get almost the same dishes every time I come (and I""ve been a lot of times). The apps are awesome. I LOVE the Dan dan noodles and the kung pao tofu. I sometimes come and just get the both of those. They are always packed - not surprised but sitting at the bar is comfortable and quick. Service is quick and efficient. Great place."
5,1,"We, 4 of us total, came here because it was busy outside last night for dinner time and we decided to do a walk in for lunch today and it was still about 45 min wait. There's a second floor and it is gorgeous especial with the Christmas decorations everywhere. The waiter was extremely nice and explain everything well, from appetizer to entree and let us know that the sizes of the food are family shared. We got fried calamari as an appetizer and it's the biggest appetizer we've ever seen. We also got lasagna, shrimp paramagiana, and chicken scalloped scapiana, and the portion sizes were huge, and really delicious. We had to take two entrees to go. Great food, great company, and awesome service!"
4,1,"Gotta start this off by saying I'm not a huge soul foodie but Pies N Thighs is solid great food! ??After salivating over their menu, I went with the basic Chicken and Waffles. HOLY amazeballs. Pretty authentic classic dish and full of flavor. My friend got the brisket sandwich which was enough for a meal and a half. ??The biscuit was warm and butterful. Got to stop writing about this, it is making me hungry. While there is typically a wait for this place with local hip youngsters, it is definitely worth waiting for. Check it out."
4,1,"Between the massive hype and the uber-hipsterness of its location and clientele, I can't help but feel slightly embarrassed to be jumping on the bandwagon (made of reclaimed wood and hand-bleached canvas cover, of course) to say this is really good pizza. But it is. It is really good pizza. Those big ol' ovens aren't just for show. They hosted and catered my friend's wedding with these annoying individual-sized pizzas, buffet style (That is the only size they make, right? They weren't just being douches by serving 100+ people with three personal pies at a time, right?). They had a few different types of pizza. Bee Sting, four cheese, veggie, and something else that I forgot. Wow. They were all really delicious. The thin crust was perfectly crispy and chewy, the sauce to cheese ratio was balanced, and the toppings complemented each other. I think my favorite was the Bee sting, which had the mozzarella, soppressata, and honey. I really like the salty-sweet combo with just a little spicy kick. All pizzas were served piping hot right from the oven. I'm not sure I would say it's the best pizza in NYC (Places like Lucali still have the edge), but it is definitely up there. If you're one of the masses on a quest to try all of NYC's best pizzas, this one should go on your list."
5,1,"We were lucky to get a seat before the lunch menu ended. From what the host told us they close to cleanup and prepare for the dinner session. He told us that we had to order fast and take our time to eat. We looked at the menu and picked the obvious, the prix-menu of 3 courses for a set price of $25. It was well worth the cost, we had their famous ""buns"" and it was delicious. Both entries (fish and pork) were perfectly cooked. ?? Definitely will come back to try out the dinner seating and willing to find two new friends to eat the famous fried chicken. (Was told that I needed a minimum seating of 4 people to order the fried chicken.)"
4,-1,"Overall, very happy! Food was delicious---I had the pasta and french inion soup and my companion had the Mac n Cheese with Braised Short Ribs. Cooked and seasoned to perfection! Wine-eh...hopefully there will be a better selection as I was unimpressed with the few bottles they had to offer. Hopefully it is because they are new but a food wine selection makes a huge difference. Cocktails are good---need improving as far as alcohol selection they had on hand. Atmosphere is classy, crisp and rustic - a great addition to the ever changing Bay Street scene. With good management this plane could be an amazing spot! Oh---movie nights, too on the outdoor patio!"
5,-1,Obsessed.
5,1,Jambalaya was insane!!! ??Byob is great. Didi is SO NICE. Fish fry was amazing and the sweet potato fries delicious. My friends go all the time and raved about how mysteriously amazing this place is. I agree!
5,-1,"Best pierogi by far in the East Village, and I have tried many others. Very friendly staff, for the afternoon Andrew and Robert, and the morning Chester and Roman, Chester making the best scrambled eggs I think I've ever had. They only complaint I have is that the leg room is not the best, but the food substitutes for that 20 fold."
5,1,"About half a year ago, one of my coworkers told me that he had found a West Village restaurant called Palma that I would adore. I don't know why it took me so long to finally check it out, but after a lovely Saturday brunch here, I'm already trying to convince friends that we need to check it out for dinner. Discreetly located in the middle of the sidewalk with a sign outside that says the garden is open, it's easy to pass by Palma if you don't turn your head. But if you do, you'll see a simple, but cute little room and if you step into the doorway and walk through the narrow hallway, you will find yourself in the garden (you could also sit in the room, but the garden is way cuter). Filled with plants and floral tableclothes, the garden makes you feel like you are out in the countryside soaking in the sunshine and without a care for the world. The service was fantastic and the food, even better. I ordered the mushroom omelette with greens and potatoes. Everything on the plate was delicious! The wild mushrooms were so flavorful and the omelette just cooked so well. The greens were lightly dressed and great for eating in between bites of the omelette. The potatoes were standard, which means I enjoyed them. My friends and I all finished everything on our plates and while we were all full, we weren't the uncomfortable kind of stuffed that you often feel after brunch. And then, inspired by the sunshine and garden, we slowly walked all the way up to Central Park and enjoyed the rest of our sunny Saturday. I don't know if the garden stays open all year round, but I will definitely be back for dinner and more brunch."
4,1,"Finally tried something here besides cheesecake. Came in for breakfast on a Monday morning. Got seated immediately. ?? Had the Eggs Benedict. Tasted as I'd expect it to. The hollandaise sauce was good - not too much lemon and not too much sauce - just the right amount. Tori was our server and she was nice, although scarce. We had to request coffee/drink refills from the bus boys. This was disappointing especially because the dining room was only half full."
4,1,"Small place, small plates, but great flavors. Even though you can easily spend $$$ here, the taste of each plate is well-designed and quite delicious. The usual items on the menu are varied and their specials are an interesting addition to the regular customers. The sangria is also a great pairing to the food. One star off is it is quite the small place and pretty cramped."
3,1,"Another good place for Cuban.. The chicken empanadas are good, and lunch specials are decent. The waitresses, uhummm... haha!!"
2,-1,"This place is nothing to die for.....not an amazing atmosphere and the food was really boring...not enough salt,not enough spices...the steak was the worst i have ever tried in my life...:( so i don't see the reason to go back ....the only good think about this place was the service!!!"
3,1,"Pho and Banh Mi have been getting more popular in NYC during the last few years so it's not too surprising to see a place like Saigon Shack opening up around this area. ??Considering how bad some of the Vietnamese places outside of the Chinatowns are in ??NYC, it's a pretty pleasant surprise to find out that this place is pretty decent for both the sandwiches and the noodle soup. ??There are a few minor quibbles I have with the each selection that keeps it from 4 stars in my opinion. We started off with a side of fried dumplings. ??The skin was a little thicker than ideal but otherwise it was nicely crunchy from the frying and goes well with the sweet sauce that comes as a dip. The classic Banh Mi's pork was nice and juicy but not as flavorful as those found in places like Banh Mi Saigon and Ba Xuyen. ??Since those two are the gold standard in NYC for Banh Mi's for now, it's not too surprising. ??What could be easily improved is that the baguette could be toasted a little more to give it a bit more of a crunch. ??Otherwise this Banh Mi makes good use of everything including the pickled veggies, cilantro, hot pepper (if you ask for it) and mayo to make a good sandwich. The Pho comes in a gigantic bowl. ??At first you'll wonder how you'll finish it all until you realize that it is only about 2/3 full. ??Quantity wise, I'll say this is equivalent to a regular sized bowl of Pho in Vietnamese places found in Chinatown. ??Just remember that regular size is the smallest selection at those places. ??Still, it's a decent amount of food for most people except for pigs like me that always goes for large or extra large portions. ??It'll be nice if they have this option in the future. ??Taste wise, I would say the broth is a little bit on the bland side and could be slightly richer. ??This was remedied slightly with the side of condiments that they provide for you but a perfect Pho shouldn't need it. ??The rice noodles that we had that day was clumped together as if it could have used a tad more cooking time. ??It was slightly a bit too al dente too. ??Despite my criticism, there are many good things about the Pho here. ?? They give you a side of lemon AND lime wedges which is a nice touch. ??Most places gives you only one or the other. ?? They also give you sliced chili pepper on a small plate ??along with ??bean sprouts and cilantro. ??The amount of sliced beef that comes with the soup is pretty generous for Pho. Definitely more generous than the places I've been to in Chinatown. ??Overall, it's a pretty competent version of Pho that will warm you up in the winter times like now and fill you up in the summer time (unless you are like me). Speaking about keeping you warm, this place is nice and toasty in the winter time. ??At least it is until a patron passes through the door. ??For my dining partner and I, we ate in there while just chilling out ??... but every time the door opened the chilling out became literal. ??It's a pretty small place so from what I could tell, there is only one spot that you could sit at to avoid the dreaded inevitable blast of cold air. ??It's to the far left at the very front of the restaurant when you enter. ?? I'm going to assume this will be ??a prized seat for the regulars here in the future during winter time. They need to find some way to modify the door to keep the cold air out or else dining in won't be too pleasant for most people unless you are part of the polar bear club. Price wise, because of the location, the food here isn't as cheap as in Chinatown but that is to be expected. ??Nothing could beat Chinatown in prices for food. ??Luckily everything seems pretty reasonably priced considering the higher rent of the area. ??The Pho was $8, and the Bahn Mi was $5. ??This place should tide people over if they are craving Vietnamese food, is in the area, and don't want to travel a bit further down to Chinatown for it."
3,-1,"Love the food - we would spend $1,000 more a year at this place if they used a reasonable online delivery service - but what they use (Caviar) basically adds 50% in fees and tips to a $50 - $70 order. That's insane - and NYC is a place where delivery is a way to let smaller restaurants really maximize their kitchen output. So instead of ordering in weekly, we pick up or eat in 4x a year. Sad."
4,1,"A good find,but not particularly cheap (8-13 dollars a main). Tasty. We had the Ma Po Tofu and the Eggplant dish. Oh yeah, the Salt and Pepper chicken strips were super good. Such texture! Service was really friendly."
5,-1,"Possibly the closest you're going to get to New Orleans in NYC. This little treasure has the best ambiance and it actually feels like you're in nola. The food is DELICIOUS ??and cooked to perfection. Things I tried: Crawfish Bordin Balls- Yum Pork Bordin Balls- Yummmmm Abita Shrimp- :-D :-D :-D Chicken Po boy- Enormous and very tasty (craving it as I'm typing) Mac and Cheese- Better than kraft, Best Mac & cheese I've had to date Note: You have not had the full experience until you check out the bathrooms. They are adorable."
5,1,"Awesome food, fantastic service, and great atmosphere!"
5,-1,"Last night was our third trip Las Ramblas in the past month and a half -- this is quickly becoming our favorite Greenwich Village restaurant. ??The quality of the tapas are second to none in NYC. ??Try the Baby Lamb Chops, Setas al Jerez, Atun con Romero Tuna, Patatas Bravas, and the classic sizzling garlic Shrimp. ??We loved the Rice Pudding for dessert too! ??Susan and I both love wine with our dinner and have really enjoyed the many quality regional Spanish wines they sell here by the glass. ??I think there are more than 30 on the list! ??We found the prices always reasonable and the service has been consistently great. ?? Yesterday we waited about 15 minutes for a table on a busy Friday night with a buzzer they gave us. ??Not bad, as this is a very popular restaurant. ??The crew has always been very welcoming, knowledable, and friendly. ??Their wine recommendations have always been right on. ??We also liked their stylish bathroom and beautiful copper bar. ??For us the only draw back is that Las Ramblas isn't closer to where we live in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn."
5,1,"Wonderful Resturant & Lounge!! Customer Service was amazing, Food was great!! Is one of my top favorites!!"
5,1,"My husband and I honeymooned in Italy and this place is the closest we have come to authentic Italian food! The ambiance of this place is adorable and reminded us of one of the restaurants we went to in Florence. We arrived a little early for our reservation but were seated right away in the outside portion which was so quaint! We were immediately greeted by our server who was wonderful and went over the specials. They have an extensive wine list with some reasonably priced bottles of Italian wine! We started with a bottle of wine and the prosciutto with fresh mozzarella for two. The cheese is obviously home made on the spot, the prosciutto was fabulous and it is topped with fresh basil, YUM! I ordered the gnocchi ricotta which is made with a black truffle sauce. I had this dish two times while in Italy and I feel that Uva's version is extremely comparable, it is delicious. My husband had the special which was a sausage pasta that he loved. The only complaint we had was that the food came out so fast! We were used to Italian taking a little while so you could have more time to ""dine"". I would for sure recommend this place to anyone craving some authentic Italian food and ambiance."
4,1,Lovely cocktails and even lovlier atmosphere.
5,-1,"Great Food, Great Drinks, Great Staff"
5,-1,"Well I have only one word: AMAZING! so I came here on Friday night, October 3, to have my birthday dinner with my family, and we had such a wonderful experience, with the food tasting delicious and the attentive staff, our waitress was wonderful, that we came back on the following sunday for BLUNCH. Our experience during the BLUNCH was even more exceptional. Our waitress MIchelle was a sweatheart, and we were even granted a free round of Mimosas because of the wait for the food. For dinner we orderd the pernil, churrasco and pollo a la plancha, it was all delicious. For Blunch we ordered the burger with egg and guacomole, the churrasco and the mofongo with shrimp, again it was all good. The drinks were perfection. The frozen sangria is becoming my favorite drink. It's sweet enough that you dont taste the alcohol, but strong enough to get the job done, and when you check in using Yelp, you get a free one! Absolutely love this place, from the wonderful location, to the exquisite dishes, and the best service Ive received at a restaurant in a while, from the hostess to the waitress, extremely friendly and attentive to ensure that you truly enjoy your time there. I highly recommend it, whether it's a date night, a night out with friends, or for a special occasion. I'll be coming back soon for sure!"
4,1,"Great fun atmosphere that could be casual or dressy. ?? Great service, super friendly servers. ??Nice wines by the glass. Farm-fresh ingredients from grilled fava beans in the pod to purslane-blueberry-hazelnut salad to beets-mint-ricotta to rockshrimp w/ lambsquarters to brined rotisserie chicken. ??Everything is really fresh and vibrant. ??Everything was absolutely delicious.....Just not the desserts. ??We were 0 for 3. ??Maybe it was a bad night. ?? Rhubarb pie was SOUR and the crust mushy, choco cake w/ salted caramel frosting was tasty but ice cold, molasses ginger cookies were sadly ginger-less. Still totally recommend it. ??Just don't get dessert."
5,-1,"This shit is good, damn good. It was good enough for me to finally make a yelp account. With apologies to my favourite local Indian place, but they have you beat. The samosa was the best I've ever had. He wasn't kidding when he said the vindaloo was hot - I'm sure I'll be as hot coming out ??in the morning - but I want my vindaloo hot. When an Indian guy says his food is hot, you know it's damn hot. The naan was great as was my partner's chicken tika. There were a few things missing. There wasn't a crabby old Indian woman filling my glass with water every few minutes. It was a guy and he smiled while pouring water. I would have liked a paneer option as an app. It's on the second floor, so kinda hard to find, but hunt it out. You won't be disappointed."
4,-1,"The food was so delicious, authentic, fresh, and mouth watering. I loveeee Italian food. There was a very well fed looking gentleman just devouring his pasta with an honest expression of happiness on his face. The portions were large, though I regret getting the veal franchese. I'll definitely go back here the next time I'm in Little Italy."
5,-1,"The chocolate chip cookies at Boubouki are some of the BEST I've ever had! I've never had such wonderous chocolate chip cookies! How good? My gentleman and I travelled out of our way, from the UES all the way to the Essex Market this past Friday just to get some of these cookies. Luckily, there were 3 left which we promptly scooped up. We also tried some of the almond shortbread, which were equally amazing. I'm looking forward to trying the spinach pie on our next trip to New York."
5,1,"Excellent place. ??Convenient and great priced for the portions and TASTE! ??Homemade pop tarts, cakes, bars, cookies etc. ??Chocolate cubes on a stick that melt away in your hot milk..... Sandwiches and salads are loaded with unique flavors in every bite. ??Great place to just hang out with a cup of coffee. ??Great atmosphere and friendly workers... Another great addition to Williamsburg!!"
5,1,"I have never yelped before, but reading other yelp reviews helped me pick this bar, so I want to pay it forward. I highly highly recommend Swift if you are looking for a great bar to host a party at. I recently celebrated a birthday @ Swift and, from what I remember (JK), the staff could not have been more accommodating. I had reserved in advance space for 30-40 (@ no cost) and Swift had set aside over half of the back room for my group. Since, I had about 40+ throughout most of the night, my space was filled but not uncomfortable. Responding to what one of the previous reviewers said about unnecessarily reserved space, the staff are clear that if you party does not show up or is smaller than expected, they'll give up the reserved space, which is fair. Swift had two waitresses serving our party and they were friendly, prompt, organized and remembered drink preferences. I've been to other parties where you are required to order from a specific waiter/ress but they hardly every come by to take orders. Not the case at Swift. (Thanks Brooke!!j). The drink variety was great and the prices fair. The DJ was friendly and played a great mix. Some of my friends were disappointed that he didn't play more top-40 dance music, but he played a nice variety given that its not a club. I had a fantastic time and so did my friends. Though its near NYU, the bar didn't feel college-y at all. My group ranged btwn mid-20s to mid-30s and no one felt out of place. From 9:30 to 2:30am I drank heavily, danced and had an all around grand time! Next time I have to plan a party, I'm definitely coming back!"
4,1,"Excellent Northern Italian food. Paprika cooks exclusively with EVOO and the staff will happily sub out your sides. I highly recommend the steak, crunchy carrots, spinach and potatoes. I also recommend reservations, unless you plan on dining later in the evening. The reason for four stars? It simply wasn't *outstanding* enough to merit five."
3,1,"Mixed. Went for dinner Tuesday night. I enjoy the space, lots of room no one hitting your elbows and not too crowded. They also have a nice bar with more space than most. One of the cocktails, the dark and stormy, we ordered was terrible, didn't have more than a sip. They give plenty of bread before meal which is a plus. ??Had a shrimp app which was amazing. The olives app was big enough to split between 10 people I think. The dinners were a bit disappointing. Some of the flavor combinations were strange in the steak dinner. The chicken was very hard to eat and although the swordfish was good it was the only thing that didn't come with a side, and it was then too late to order sides. The homemade ice cream was great! I might come back and try out brunch but other than that not too motivated to return."

The music was so loud we couldn't hear each other."

4,1,"BEST BLUEBERRY PANCAKES IN NYC! It's so good, fluffy, huge size portion, tasty, buttery, heavenly, etc. I didn't love the egg dishes so I won't rate this the best brunch but the only reason to come here anyway is for the pancakes. The maple butter just adds the best finishing touch to the pancakes. We also had dessert (apple crumb sundae) which was so decadent, sweet and delicious. I loved it. This place is SO SO cute but very small/cramped. We waited for 1.5 hours to get a table. Best advice is to go right when it opens and don't go with more than 1 other person or you will wait longer. But, again, the pancakes are worth the wait."
4,1,"My friend and I went for dinner around 6:10 and were seated immediately at the bar. She ordered a salmon steak while I got the hanger steak, and we shared the spinach gratin and mashed potatoes. All the food was absolutely delicious! The salmon steak was giant and cooked/seasoned perfectly (she ordered it medium). My hanger steak was delicious as well and had a great char taste. The sides were also great but slightly salty for my taste. They still tasted good enough for us to both have finished both sides, though! We ended with the chocolate and salted caramel pot-de-creme afterwards and it was a perfect ending to a great meal. I really enjoyed this meal and hope to come back!"
1,-1,"Abominable service started with a nasty owner/hostess who refused to serve me a cup of hot water on a freezing cold day. Ice water is the only form of water they serve, regardless of season. The waiter had to refer to the owner for every little request. It was embarrassing for us and for him as the owner gleefully denied everything. She was totally inflexible, all simple queries were refused like ""Can I have this pasta with a tomato sauce instead of a tomato cream sauce?"" The food was terrible. But the terrible service overshadowed the terrible food. I assume they are not expecting any repeat customers. Tourists are their target market. Visited January 2013"
2,-1,"2 stars just for food..food is great BUT service is terrible...you can get your hot app before your salad, nobody ask if we need something else..they have to hire more professional wait stuff..."

5,1,"Amazing! Made reservations in the private dining area since ??we weren't sure how busy the bar section would be. Had the kale salad, chicken soup, bass w/peanut curry sauce, and the chocolate banana dessert. So delicious! Excellent service! The house breads were yummy and they gave us 3 pieces! I cannot eat dairy so they made our meal with no dairy and it was so good!! Must go place in NY!"
5,-1,"I like this place better than Chevelas!! Chevelas is cute but I think their vegetarian options are meh. The fried avocado/jalapeno taco is super tasty. ??Also really good marghs -- not super cheap, but that is because they are fresh -- none of the fluorescent lime crap. ?? The people who work there are also nice and obviously pumped to be making delish food. ??It's also open late(!!) which is a very exciting thing in Crown Heights."
5,-1,The best restaurant in the whole town and meal of that restaurant is very tasty and have high quality food so i am so glad and happy after the lunch.
4,1,"I took my girlfriend to Moto for Valentine's Day dinner. ??They offered a $50 three-course prix fixe which included a glass of champagne or a kir royale; this is more expensive than it would be on a normal night (if you look at the menu online, entree prices range from $11 to $17, which is really quite reasonable), but not unreasonable when you consider that a lot of places do Valentine's Day prix fixe menus at $75 and up. We were seated promptly when we arrived (they take reservations for special occasions, though not for normal nights), and the service was friendly. ??There was live music, and the atmosphere was awesome; pleasant lighting, flower petals everywhere including on the tables, in the restroom, and even on the sidewalk outside. ?? OK, so here's the problem, and the reason why I didn't give 5 stars after an otherwise great experience. ??Our appetizers came out promptly after our drinks: a great red snapper tartare and a fennel soup with chunks of lobster. ??And then... ??nothing. ??We waited for our main courses for a solid hour and 15 minutes, until we started to wonder whether maybe the staff had forgotten us; in fact, the couple next to us waited for their dessert for almost as long, and we overheard them remarking on it as well. ??Eventually the entrees did show up, and both (pasta with veal ragu and grilled scallops) were very good. ??Then another little while passed, and, before we received our desserts which were included in the prix fixe, the waiter came over to ask us if we wanted anything else or if he could bring us a check; maybe he actually did forget about us! ?? But then once I mentioned this oversight, the waiter seemed to realize that he hadn't been paying enough attention to us, and comped us two glasses of port with our dessert to make amends. ??Overall, not a perfect experience, but a lot of positives to recommend it. ??Would definitely go back to check it out on a regular night."
4,1,"As I yelped, looking for a GOOD Indian place in NYC, (mostly in my neighborhood, which I have yet to find - If anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to check them out) I kept coming across the Kati Roll Company ""What the hell is a Kati Roll?"" I said to myself. ??Each and every time I saw this name come up... ""what the hell ARE these things?"" One word summary? Delicious. ??They, apparently are an Indian street food, Made like a burrito, but far more awesome. Spiced meats, optional eggs, wrapped in a shell, not unlike a tortilla, punching you in the face with flavor. I dig on this place a lot - It's probably better when you're really drunk."
5,-1,Delicious and always fresh Falafel. In my opinion it's the best Falafel place in Forest Hills. Ask Wafa which food is fresh that day and go with her recommendations.
4,-1,"Great meal. We ended up there on a whim this week and were quite impressed with the menu. We were further impressed when we realized it was restaurant week and there was a 3-course menu for $35. You would never had known it was restaurant week, there were 8-10 choices in each catagory (appetizer, entree, dessert). Food was excellent, portion sizes a bit hit or miss. My boyfrinds salmon tartare was literally laughably small, about a shotglass full. My mushroom consomme was giant. I would give them 5 stars but they gave us a table in the bar area instead of the dining room as we requested and we were told they were 'fully committed.' Normally I wouldnt care but we were the last table that came in the whole place, it was Monday night. Anyways, big credit to Riverpark for not cheaping out on restaurant week and giving us a true idea of their menu. We'll be back"
5,1,"This small Australian coffee shop is well worth a visit - for the coffee or the food. The extremely polite and friendly staff will probably win you over before you even order. Little Collins has plenty of rotating pour-over coffee varieties (brewed right in front of you at their bar), mostly from Counter Culture coffee. If you can manage to grab a seat, though, their ""Brekkie"" and lunch sandwiches are some of the best in Midtown! I recommend the brisket (if it's available) or the cured ham."
3,-1,I've been to MP Taverna twice .the first time I had really good experience . The food was great ??as well as the service but I can't say the same thing about my second visit... we were seating at the bar. We waited quite long until the bartender greeted us and offered menus. after it took even longer to order and get the food ...my favorite from the menu is the grilled octopus salad ... mmm so good!
1,-1,"So disappointed in this restaurant. We were celebrating our anniversary, and thought we would share a special experience at Bouley. Couldn't get a table until 9:00 p.m., and upon arrival, needed to wait an additional 45 minutes to be seated. Bread was stale, the salmon was drenched in sauce, soupy, unappealing. Service was practically non-existent. Good thing we didn't order the tasting menu, as we feel like we wasted enough money on this place."
5,-1,"Oh my gosh!!!! Mister hotpot was the greatest dinner I ever had. They have tons of selection and the soup selection was great! Best of all, their waiter was so nice to me. He help us when we needed. Oh yeah. His name is Jeffery. I love this place!!!"
3,-1,"Came in before a show and sat at the bar. ??What is wrong with the owner and managers of this restaurant. ??Do they really think that old man behind the bar is funny with his mean humor. ??They to need to FIRE him. ??The way he treats his co-workers( the busser and the the girl working with him behind the bar). ??It's unbelievable how his co workers takes his abusive humor and still try to have a smile on their face while serving the customers. ?? I felt so bad for the girl behind the bar, while she tried to keep a smile on her face while that mean old man belittled her in front of a bar full of customers. ??I guess she really needs her job... I refuse to go eat their again as long as that man has a job there and I will be spreading the word about staying from Junior's as long as he is there....No MATTER HOW GOOD THE CHEESCAKE WAS!!!!!"

1,-1,"My main dish of fish and rice (special) $12.00. ??Plain rice was in a small bowl no more than 6 oz., and some kind of bass fish, when skin removed, had some kind of fish bones, rice was too crunchy like the rice stuck on the pot. ??Had to spit out in my napkin because rice was so hard. ??Waiter was busy talking to others, had to call for everything. ??When asked about the special, he said it is only $12 what do you expect.? ??Noticed flies going around. ??Also, noticed 19 violations at NY City violations site. ??Unfortunately, there is no other thai/chinese restaurant on that blvd., ??Probably, will not go there again."
5,1,"What a great little place in Brooklyn! ??This place has a small menu but everything that I have had is delicious. ??The Kale salad is so tasty- great miso dressing. ??And then I always get the Kimchi Ramen- the broth is great, the noodles are cooked perfectly, and then kimchi and an egg? Yes, please. ??I always secretly want to sneak in a fork so that I can shovel it in my mouth even faster but I guess I can stick with ceramic soup spoon and chop sticks."
4,-1,"Went with a few friends to get dinner- amazing. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because we were all a little cramped against the table next to us (small place) but it was nice out and the windows were open. Until I got to Barrio Chino I had yet to find good fish tacos in the city that came close to back home in southern CA, but theirs are really good. Nice portion, reasonably priced and GREAT grapefruit margaritas + sangria. GO"

The people couldn't have been nicer letting my husband and I sit & wait for our friends while sipping jasmine tea. Our friend did the ordering and we had Shanghai dumpling, crab dumplings, beef wonton, a tofu dish, another beef dish and the house special ribs. All was tastybut the Shanghai dumplings and ribs were my favorites. The sauce in the rib dish is thick, gingery, full of flavor and the rib meat tender and just falling off the bone. The place kept filling up and yet we were never rushed out of our seats. Great final night in NyC"
1,-1,"Never , never again would I go to Peaches , the service is poor , the wait is too long and the take out price for a meal is to high , they charge you adult price for a portion side kid meal !!!!!!!!!!!!!! , I also invited friends from out of town , they were also extremity disappointed with the hostility , never again would I go to Peaches again !!!!!Big E !!!!!!!!"
4,-1,"All of the dishes were prepared well and lived up to expectations. But the reason I will be returning was the tremendous service. When we arrived, my friend and I were looking forward to a specific dish, and upon being told that they were out of the dish, the waiter noticed our severe disappoint. Much to our delight, 5 minutes later he returned with the dish and said they managed to scrap together one last plate of it, and served it to us free of charge. That's how you run a restaurant."

4,1,"The over all experience of Sushi Yasuda was really good. ??I ordered the Sashimi platter and the Seaweed appetizer. ??The Seaweed platter was very unique and different. ??The sashimi was awsome, it just melted in my mouth, easily best i've had yet. ??The atmosphere is very serene and the service was excellent. The only thing negative about Sushi Yasuda is that every thing is very price and some what comes in small portions. If you're looking for good price sushi that is good but won't burn a whole in your wallet, this is not really the place for you. ??However, if you can afford it, I would definitely recommend it."
3,-1,"Don't enter the hipster's den and complain about all the hipsters, that's just dumb. ?? That's like going to France and complaining about all the French people.

Please. ??Pizza is ok."
4,-1,"This place is in my neighborhood. Has a decent selection of really good sandwiches. ??The owner also cooks up delicious whole chickens for $6 each. ??These aren't just plain birds he stuffs them with rosemary, lemon and other great herbs to make a truly great dinner for really cheap."

2,1,"BEST THAI IN NYC?! Not really...That is a loaded statement... so I was expecting literally to be transplanted back in Thailand for an hour while experiencing my meal. Not so. Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes, but we did order some dishes recommended by some other Yelpers and rather disappointed with the results. - Spicy Watercress Salad: The picture doesn't tell you that this dish is fried. Every single stalk of watercress is deep fried, how can you even call this dish a salad? There's a whole mess of sauce in the middle that you have to mix around before eating any of it, and I thought that sauce was way too salty. - Massaman Curry: I was tempted to order the Green Curry but wanted to try something different. This curry was the best dish out of everything we ordered, but still not as good as I would have thought. The tamarind/cardamon spices weren't strong enough, the flavors lacking a bit in depth, but all around a pretty good dish. - Spicy Pork with Chili Peppers: These bite sized, deep fried pork bits had a very crunchy texture, faintly reminiscent of fried pork rinds. It wasn't that spicy - and I could see that everyone was ordering this dish as well but just could'nt see what was that great about it. - Rice with Chicken Stock: Actually very fragrant, moist, and fufll of flavor.. when they ask you for what kind of rice you want, pick this! - Mango with Sticky Rice and Coconut Milk: I've been looking forward to this dessert for quite some time now since I haven't been able to find it at other Thai places. Thank goodness the mango was sweet because the worst thing is if your mangos taste like tofu=flavorless! I happen to really like sticky rice because it's not too sweet but the sticky texture compliments the sweetness of the mango very nicely and the sweet coconut milks adds an extra zing to the entire dessert. At Sripraphai, the sticky rice was a tad too stiff...not soft enough. I would say Green Papaya in Flushing still has the best mango with sticky rice. Service: My waiter was pretty quick and efficient, definitely didn't experience bad service like some others had mentioned. I would say definitely give this place a shot and see what you think about it since a lot of other Yelpers seem to think that this place is fantabulous. Maybe I just came on a bad day..."
5,1,The red fingerling potato gnocchi was out of this world amazing. Highly recommend.
5,-1,"One of my fave restaurants in Park Slope. ??The educated waitstaff knows their shit and made me learn stuff about local farming, pastured animals, and other fancy things that enhanced each delicious morsel. Go!"
3,1,"I'm giving this 3-stars after weighing the good, the bad and the overhyped, which this restaurant does have, unfortunately. And I mean that it's unfortunate bc I'm a fan of McNally's other restaurant ventures like Balthazar's. The good: the roasted bone marrows are delicious! Not many restaurants in this fine cutting edge city carry these on the menu and kudos to Minetta for making this a permanent staple. [I mean, that many carnivores in the animal kingdom can't be wrong! marksdailyapple.com/bone?£á? ] If you are going to have them and if you must have another dish to complement, then I'd suggest a lighter dish as it's rich and the appetizer portion comes with 4 good-sized bones. Don't do what I did and get the bone marrow AND the black-label burger. The bad: the unbearably cramped space. In Balthazar's, the vaulted ceiling helps to alleviate the inevitable claustrophobia and to lessen the noise factor in an otherwise crowded space. Minetta doesn't have this. i do miss the old Minetta tavern where you can leisurely grab a drink at the long narrow bar while waiting for your friends... The overhyped: that black label burger. Reader beware: it's drenched in clarified butter before they put the bun on it. It's just too much. All I tasted were the butter and the caramelized onions and none of that quaity beef."
4,1,"Headed over here Monday night when I should have really headed home, it was definitely not disappointing. ?? Randomly I went here with a friend after Rusty Knot, which as I mentioned was also fun. ??Rode my bike down, and when we walked up to the door, another friend just happened to be hanging out there!! ??An old friend that I hadn't seen in perhaps a year! ??This was serendipitous indeed, so we joined forces to make a party of five, and ordered more rounds of margaritas! Shortly thereafter a live band setup, and started playing, and we ended up getting kicked out for rowdiness and drunken trouble. ??LOL"
4,1,"PROS: Great sangria, civeche is very tasty, almost everything has a great flavor. CONS: Staff is a bit slow and disappear for long periods of time. Portions can be small, and it's a bit expensive for what it is. OVERALL: Great for drinks and a small bite."
1,-1,"Talk about a restaurant that wont be there in 6 months. ??You can usually tell the fiscal problems of a restaurant when they pour you a scotch that barely covers the bottom of the glass. ??Seriously? ??Charge me $14 and fill up my glass...this is not an airport. Then sit me in this weirdly cubic wood dining room and pretty much ignore my party for 20 minutes. ??Cant comment on the food quality as we didnt stay to partake, but I can say the alcohol value and the service were so poor that it wasnt worth waiting around to try some hummus and such. Do yourself a huge favor and Stay Away"
5,1,"Was here two days ago for my birthday and everything was good! It's surprisingly large inside with two floors of seating so even if you haven't made reservations, still try as there is a good chance that you can still be seated fairly quickly! The food is good value for its price. ??My sisters and I had the lamb shank, shrimp orzo, calamari, and mussels family style. ?? ??The food was solid and good, however, I wasn't overly impressed. ?? The service was excellent. ??There when you needed them and not overly obtrusive. I want to go back for their prixe fixe menu which looks to be a true deal!"
5,1,"Best brunch deal in the city. ??A million times better food than Blockheads but at pretty much the same price. ??With 10 different sangrias on hand as well, it's impossible to have a bad drink. However, MANAGEMENT: BRING BACK MY CUBAN SANDWICH. Previously, the Cuban sandwich was pressed down. It was a smaller portion of food, but it was juicy and had the best flavor with a little bite to it. ??NOW, the Cuban has dry bread, dry filling. ??It's really bad. ??I asked the server the last time to see if the chef could do it the old way... it came to be with a slightly heated and still dry. In protest of the civil disobedience variety, I will not return until my Cuban sandwich of the good ol days does as well. Also, that small amount of salsa you serve with it is not enough for anyone... just go ahead and serve a normal portion. Side note: the bread basket is awesome."
5,-1,Friendly shop owners. Nice pleasant vibe. Good prices. Delicious muffins.
4,1,"DELISH!!! I ordered the pulled pork pita sandwich and my bf got the chicken shwarma pita sandwich. The pulled pork was delicious and moist. But the fennel jicama apple slaw was piled on the top so each bite was not equal. The first 3-4 bites consisted of mostly slaw while the rest was purely pork shoulder. I like having all the components of a sandwich in one bite but that's just me being OCD... I envied my bf's chicken shwarma because it had curry potatoes (I love me some starch!) so I'll be ordering that next time. Each sandwich is served with a side of freshly fried potato chips. Eat these first!! They get soggy after a few minutes. And you MUST order the mint lemonade. Sooo refreshing! I didn't really think the flavor profiles of our pita sandwiches were very Mediterranean but everything was still tasty and satisfying. The evening I came here most of the seats were taken and the occupants were lingering... typing away on laptops or chatting up a storm with their buddies with empty trays and cups in front of them. Not sure if that's the usual crowd but if it is, you might have trouble getting a seat."
4,-1,"Not bad place, like that they have seats outside, pretty crowded there, but food and atmosphere are great. U can find anything u want (fish, meat, veggies)."
3,-1,"So I came here the other day for a lunch with some friends, and had just an OK experience with it. The sandwich I got wasn't the best, but wasn't the worst either, just average I guess for the price. The service wasn't bad, and the place was decently clean, just nothing extraordinary in my experience. I may have to try this place again as it could have been just what I ordered, but we will see."
5,-1,"My girl and I just went here last weekend based on some of these reviews for our anniversary as well. Not being a very big ""planner"" I called day of for a reservation and was told they didn't do them for less than 5 people day of, and that the dining room was booked for the night, but to ask if anyone didn't show when you arrived. We got there and they said it would be about the same wait for both rooms. I let her know that it was our anniversary so we would wait for the nicer dining room with the three course meal. B/f I was done with my glass of wine, they came over to seat us....This is a place that gets all the details right...like placing out wine glasses on a tray to bring to the table...when we sat our excellent waiter came over with a bottle of sparkling wine from Spain to congratulate us on our anniversary. When it came time to order I asked his advice on three wines i liked, and having seen the price range i was looking at, and the kind of wine, he offered another suggestion that was excellent (Can Blau 05). Then we had a spoonful of fish tartar and other little veggies, apparently to awaken our palate. My girl had the crab ravioli and I got the lobster appetizer--Get the crab, the sauce was crazy good. Then for the meal I always ask my waiter and got the pork bellies and savored every bite, tender with a sauce that made me want to lick the bowl.--Side note--we know an ave amount about food and didn't know what a couple of the things on the menu were and the staff were very courteous and warm in their explanations so I didn't feel like an idiot asking what char was.---then we opted for a cheese plate and ordered three that sounded good, and she then brought over 4 kinds so we could try another she liked on the house, and ended with her getting the chocolate mouse, and I got the cheese cake---Go with the chocolate---then i finished with a cappuccino. At the end our waiter, Mathew, even brought the label to our wine in a card along with two coffee cakes to enjoy the next morning...The entire meal was excellent, the staff amazing, friendly, and very knowledgeable. the food, great--for a four course meal, a bottle of wine, and a couple of glasses to start, ??with tip it was $300 and I would gladly spend that much again.......next year (the tavern seating is cheaper)"

4,-1,"JP's is one of the most exalted versions of a gastropub that NYC has to offer.

4,1,"What's good about Elmhurst? Chinese food and supermarket (Check) Malaysian ??food? (check) Thai food? (Check) Mexican / ??Spanish Food ? (Check) BOBBA drinks (check) Vietnamese Pho? (Check) Vietnamese Sandwich (FINALLY Can CHECK this one NOW) Just rarely open this place right where all the other food restaurants are. Very convenient. ?? - Ordered the Classic Banh MI Number one (which was the Classic Pate Cha) Slices of Vietnamese Ham and headcheese with Pate Spread. ??There was an option to have it with spicy (which is not super spicy for me at all) that justs adds slices of jalapenos in it. ?? Results: ??Bread was crunchy and fresh (expect crumbs falling in your lap). ??Spiciness from 1-10 i would give it a 3. ??Didn't taste the pate much, but the meat was good. ?? - Next time I went and Ordered a KAKUNI PORK belly (number 6) also spicy. ??Results: ??Bread was a bit too dry. ??Pork belly was pretty tasty, but the layer was a bit thin. ??Saucy, and same level of spicyness. Iced Vietnamese coffee was so so, not super strong or super sweet. ?? They take cash only."
4,1,"this is a great local spot to grab a casual weeknight dinner. the prices are reasonable and the service is always fast and friendly. i love the spicy pho they have (offered as the special), so perfect for a chilly night. the grilled lemongrass chicken vermicelli bowl is also a healthy favorite! read more about it and see photos here: maisondesreveries.com/20?£á?"
5,1,"Lives up to the hype. Gotta say best hand pulled noodles I've had yet. Don't be intimidated walking in - looks pretty shabby from the outside but trust me you won't regret it. The broth i still prefer Tasty's which I find to be a bit more mild and enjoy the fresh cilantro that goes with it. The broth here is good too but it's a bit on the saltier side - if you get the beef noodle - the beef pieces are much more tender and the noodles without a doubt are better at lam's. so in conclusion - noodles and beef (better at lam's) broth (i prefer Tasty's but it's personal preference - both are good!) o and did i mention - it was only $5?! The dumplings here are excellent as well (much better than Vanessa's) and for 12 pieces for $3 you can't go wrong - they also sell frozen ones 50 pieces for $9 - great deal and they make it all fresh in house - in fact when you walk into the store you'll see what i mean - it feels like you walked into a small dumpling and noodle factory and they just happen to serve food on the side lol and fyi they do have AC, though some days they tend to not turn it on as high - there's no beers for sale like Tasty's but they let you byob"

3,1,"Came here for brunch and had an ok experience - in all fairness, it was probably my fault for not ordering a full brunch meal (I wasn't very hungry). I will definitely go back to try their full menu. Both of the items I tried were really good (burger and artichoke dip). The setting down an alley is great, and combined with the rustic decor you feel transported out of downtown Manhattan. I love the small, separate dining rooms and bars. A chill brunch crowd for a Saturday without an obscene wait when I was there. The service was pretty slow, which is the major reason why I rated it a 3 and not a 4 - I get that they want you to enjoy the full experience, but I would like to be able to get the waitress' attention on the first or second pass by, not the 8th."

After staring at the menu for a while I figured I'd build my own sandwich. That day I learned I can not even make a good sandwich for myself. Anyways, just stick to ordering the specials by number. All the hard work is done for you, while you get to look around at the little quirky imported foods lining the shelves. It's a neat place, and reminds me of the good old times when the people were good and the food was better. What? What do you mean I'm only 19, I can still remember old times... (Pricing for sandwiches can approach $10, I like to come here once a week if anything, being the poor college student that I am.)"

1,-1,Wish I could have tried the sushi but when my friend and I went there this past weekend they told us we had 30 min to eat and had to leave. Whats with that? We saw several tables that were empty and a few seats at the sushi bar and they actually limited us to the time we had to eat. I was pumped to go to this place until that whole episode
4,1,"We came here without a reservation on a Friday night and were seated immediately (later found out that they don't do reservation unless the party is 6 or more). I had the Sauteed Skate and my bf had the Rib Eye. The Skate was excellent, but the steak was just alright. What I didn't like about my dining experience was the service; our waitress never checked up on us post ordering and that was pretty lame. Overall, pretty good food and maybe I'll come back again."
4,1,I love this place Whenever I'm in the BK WBurg area I make it a point to stop by. The price are great and the food is always top notch. You can even get a Falafle sandwich for only $3! The only thing that I wish they'd change would be the skimmpyness on the white sauce! I mean come man! That bring it all together! I'm also a big fan of the pickles and red cabbge too.

5,-1,amazing stuff
5,1,"Jadis is FANTASTIC! pros: - everything on the menu looked wonderful. there wasn't an overwhelming array of options and it was thus relatively easy to choose something for the night. - we got the duck rillettes, the artichoke & parmesan crostinis, the quiche lorraine and the creme brulee. all absolutely delicious. - cute decor - really nice ambiance - good service cons - got really packed as the night went on (9pm-ish; when we arrived at 7:30, it was totally fine); it might be hard to get seats overall, it was a great experience. the back had some nice couches and an open area which looked pretty cool. we were a bit wary about coming here because all the reviews raved about the wine, but it's a perfectly great place to go even if you don't drink."

3,-1,Has definitely fallen to catering to the casually dressed tourist and bar trade even when meals are priced at levels comparable to some of the ??finest restaurants in NYC. Having arrived a bit early my party was confined to a small waiting area with no opportunity for drink service. Fought for attention and service at the bar and returned with hands full while the unobliging management staff looked on. Dinner service was spotty; choices a bit I'll-conceived and generally not satisfying. ??If you frequent class NYC dining spots you dont need this kind of abuse. Plenty of other choices for fine dining. I'll go back there for a burger and beer as I understand the bar menu is more reasonable and more in line with expectations.
4,1,"If you're down for adventures to Queens there are many culinary surprises to be had. Walk down Roosevelt and you will find bountiful restos galore. I have heard about SPP for years but just did not get around to visiting. Eventually I did and believe that it tops my Pad See Eew taste tester. Now all I need to do is go to Thailand for the final test. The toss up for best Pad See Eew is between Pongsri and SriPraPhai though if I lived closer to Queens I would say hands down Sri. I was pleasantly surprised by the resto - quite big, can accommodate big parties, quick service, endless menu and child friendly! What didn't I try? For you take home junkies be sure to bring your own containers for leftovers."

I went with a friend and we ordered a bunch of small plates. Everything was great. Definitely did not dissapoint. Price was actually pretty reasonable too, since we ordered a 1/2 liter of wine. Inside is really cute. It's a lot bigger than you would expect."
2,-1,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE! I ate here last night was very torn. Although the food was VERY good (one of the best fish places in the area) the service was just awful. I waited for a table for about 20-30 and saw two couples walk out while waiting. Tables were available, they just were not cleaned up from previous diners. After finally sitting down, I ordered one of their specials, a soft shell crab wrap. About 10-15 minutes after I ordered I was informed that they used the last crabs and did not want to serve them because they were not up to par. We were chatting with the two tables on either side of us and they were not happy with the service as well. Although it must have been an off night, it made a lasting impression. I am very hesitant to return."
5,1,"I've been to a few other Umami locations back in southern California, but this one is by far my favorite. New York has some really great food, but I will never feel like I'm missing out when I go to Umami. This will be the burger I crave over and dream about forever. And despite a lot of their food items being incorporated with truffle, Umami is very affordable. Kind of disappointed they charged me $4 for a soda though. Usually I would deduct a star, but it's THAT good."
3,1,"Jane is usually not so plain but this past Sunday, I went with a few pals for the Sunday special which inlcudes salmon, or steak for about 15 bucks. Notmally I have the best meals here but this time, it was phoned in. I will not stop going but Jane can have a bad moment here and there. The fries were burnt and not very warm. The salmon was so-so and perhaps most importantly, a guest of mine became violently ill later with a bad stomach ache. I was not as bad off but had to go to bed early. I would try Jane if you are around SoHo on a weekend. Maybe brunch."
4,1,Awesome food but such a long wait ! Coffee is awesome and so is brunch !! I like the staff to they are pretty down to earth. If you really can't find a seat try and sit by the bar. U night get lucky and be able to sit quicker that way.
3,1,"Based on a recommendation from a friend, I had high hopes for Perry St. However, I left quite disappointed. The service was extremely slow and non-attentive, and the food was mediocre. The rice cracker tuna was good, but the fried chicken was dry and heavy on the batter. Overall, a very disappointing experience."
4,-1,"The service is beyond EXCELLENT they are very friendly. The roasted bone Marrow was beautiful! The cocktails while you wait (forever) are original and delicious. But I have to say the Burger was a bit of a disappointment, and I could not taste any truffles in the cod as it says it has in the menu. Lastly the crepe desserts where delicate and everything I could ask for in a dessert. Too bad the crowd has much to be desired. Reminded me a lot of the scene in Chicago, and very banker friendly."
5,1,"My all time favorite Yakitori place in town. I like its simple wabi-sabi deco aesthetics. This translates into their food preparation. The chicken here is so tasty however they make it. The salad with the tiny fish and semi-cooked egg is amazing! Good sake selection. But it's always crowded, so you have to get there early and be prepared to wait a bit. It's worth it!"
2,-1,"I came here with my sister last Thursday night at 7:45pm. We were seated upstairs. It was fairly empty when we arrived. After looking at the menu for a few minutes we made our order. We got the beef momos to share, I ordered the goat thali and she ordered the beef fried rice. Hungry and excited to try the food, we waited for over 30 minutes before they brought the momos to our table. It was slightly cold and not as good as I was expecting. They were dry and the dumpling shell chewy. For the price we paid for them, we could've gotten better dumplings/momos at a different place. Not discouraged, we hoped our entrees would be better. We waited another 30 minutes and by then I was getting frustrated. The patrons sitting by us also haven't gotten their food yet. They had ordered a few minutes after us. I was very hungry and antsy at this point. I suggest to my sister that we pay for our appetizer that we had already eaten and just leave. My sister said since we already ordered, they probably already made it and she didn't want them to waste the food. We waited another 15 minutes before they brought the food to our table. The goat thali was pretty tasty but the portions were extremely small for the price. I tried my sister's fried rice and it had a strong fish taste to it. I wasn't sure how to make of it. Overall I was highly dissatisfied with my dining experience. The atmosphere was very nice and I liked the water tins. However due to the slow service and the food, I could only give this place a 2/5. We won't be returning."
2,-1,"When ppl in our group suggested meeting up here after our respective Broadway shows, I decided to make an appearance (basically to get a consensus of everyone's theatre picks-not for the food). We had eaten at Juniors during our 2007 trip. Our table of 5 got separated from the rest of our group, so I don't know about their svc. Ours was very slow (painfully so) even though we ordered burgers & corned beef sandwiches. I split the burger w/a friend & am glad cuz it wasn't tasty enough to eat the whole thing. Our food was barely warm & the waiter left us completely alone & on the verge of walking out. Very difficult getting water & sodas refilled. One of my friends had contemplated ordering dessert, but gave up because she didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for someone to simply slice a piece of cake. Ridiculous... In 2008 when my group ate there again, I decided to forgo any edibles & just chat w/my travelmates. I got a $2.50 Coke-that's all (it took 20 minutes to arrive). I did observe my companions' frustration w/the excruciatingly slow service & average (probably too glowing a term) food. One person tried the cheesecake & was offering tastes to everyone simply because she didn't want it & it wasn't feasible to take back to the hotel. Note: this person Never leaves behind food. Atmosphere-isn't! Really, it's loud, bright, crowded, overstuffed. I think I'd rather eat at Grand Central for atmosphere...what does THAT say?? It reminded me of Shoney's: ppl charging too much for frozen or prepackaged food. It is convenient to the theatre district & times square, so if you want to sacrifice one meal of your life that you can never get back in the name of convenience then have at it. IMO, Life is too short to eat crappy food. Add to that subpar svc & you're just heading down a slippery slope. There are too many delicious places to eat in NYC to sacrifice time to Juniors. I really hate to give a bad rating & it does sound harsh, but I'd prefer someone to warn me from the outset. If anyone in my group mentions this as an after theatre destination next year, I'm just gonna go my own way for the evening. A solo offering from the deli next door to the hotel would appeal to me more."
1,-1,Great food however customer service is lacking. Seems like most of the staff especially the hostess hates their job. I don't understand how you can be rude to someone as soon as they walk in the door. The staff ruined our experience I this place. Food was good. Hostess and a few others suck.
4,-1,"Went to Verlaine with a friend who introduced me to this place. My first impression was that it was a very warm welcoming place. We sat on the bar stools and had our drinks and food. Ofcourse I had to try there lychee martinis, which I was told they were known for. They were def strong, not watered down as I would think they would be for $5. Definitely a fan of the martiini. Everyone at the bar was practically living on the lychee martini. I had one and that was it for me, it was strong and I was kinda nervous that if I had more than one I might not make it out of the place on my own lol. So I ended up ordering a jamaican beer, which is always good. Our bartender was really friendly. We were hungry as well so ordered food at the bar. I had the mushroom dumpling which was really good but some of it was not cooked all the way thru so some parts tasted a bit doughy. I was still hungry so I ordered the vegetable lo mein which was delicious. You can never go wrong with a place that has it all, atmostphere, ambience, drinks and food!!! I would def go back!"
4,-1,"Came here for dinner about half a year ago, tried the pork buns, they were pretty decent. Had the roasted pork belly really loved that dish, the cabbage that comes with it matches really well with the pork. Service was attentive despite it getting busy as the drinking crowds starting building up, will def come back."
3,-1,Been here a bunch of times. Always a good time. Bartenders are good at there jobs and make great drinks. Food is also on par also. The ambience is cool because not many places in astoria have a similar one so its a refreshing step out the norm!
4,-1,"I have to agree with most of the posts - been here twice, including ""the line"" at 5pm when it opens on Saturday and one time for a 45 minute wait. ??Had Akamaru Modern both times - real wonderfulness in a bowl and unlike other ramen I have had in NYC. Also had the fried chicken pieces as a starter (squeeze the lemon over the pieces). Left very, very, very satisfied...."
4,-1,"Just got back from beyond sushi, and it was beyond yummie! The Rolls are absolutely delightful, large, filling, vegan, and beautiful. The ambiance is quite nice. ??It seems the whole place was very well thought out. ??Everything is made to order, I was eating my sushi about 60 seconds after I finsihed ordering it. ??I will be going back with friends soon!"
5,-1,Fantastic pizza
4,1,"5 stars for the food: I was very impressed with Carmine's expansive gluten free menu. My two non-gluten free dining companions and I ordered a gluten free pasta, which tasted like the real thing! The pasta was perfectly al dente - my non-GF dining companions agreed. 3 stars for the service: The waiter was helpful but it's not like we were about to become best friends or anything. 4 stars for the ambiance: This is your typical family style Italian restaurant. The decor is a clutter of pictures, paintings, and knick knacks. 4 stars overall: I highly recommend this restaurant for the theater district, an area that doesn't really have many good places to eat IMHO. This is a good restaurant for large groups because the dishes are meant to be shared."
5,1,"Outstanding on so many levels. ??Great ??appetizers that are truly bite sized but hit the gastronomical spot. ??Entrees are so satisfying. ??Great wine list. ??When all is said and done though and if you get to come here only once in awhile because you live out of town, you have to get the all you can eat pasta trio. ."
5,-1,"we were there last night, everything was good and the price is ok too. we like the free appetites',such as the grilled fish and potato. the main course was sooooo cool. we have order the spicy tofu soup and ??stone rice. love this place."
4,1,"I pass this place on the way to my pal Maxine's place, and always thought it looked kinda cool. Then she recommended it, so of course I went. She was right: great food, great service, extremely nice owner. Not sure why it's not packed. but it will be."
4,-1,"Everything is really affordable, unlike some places that jack up prices for Organic meets and egg whites. They got themselves a very loyal customer. Keep up the good work boys and girls!"
5,1,"Sit inside a bar and drink beer on a nice spring day? Yep, that was me. Hey, we were seated next to the open windows, so it's not like we were actually inside some dark, dank bar (and this place is anything but). Great beer selection with a rotating list of drafts including some obscure beers. Get the fries because they're nice and crispy and evenly salted. My friends enthusiastically devoured the hot wings and declared they were delicious and warranted a return visit. Yep, we're sold."
5,-1,"This restaurant capped off my recent trip to NYC to visit family for the holidays,and I have to say, I was blown away by everything about it. The ambiance was perfect. It was dinner on the night after Christmas (12/26/12), so it wasn't crowded, but the customers who came out in the rain, like ourselves, seemed to enjoy dining in such a top-notch restaurant. Our menu was as follows: The sparkling water was plentiful and the waitstaff did not allow our glasses to go below half full. Very attentive. I had a ginger margarita, and let me just say, my local bar needs to learn a thing or two from the bartenders at ABC. Squash toast with ricotta cheese----so good it makes you wanna holla! Crab Toast---Spectacular. Did I say how much we love seafood, anyway? Mushroom Pizza with that farm fresh egg in the middle. I thought the egg would be over easy, but it was just a raw egg. Wasn't keen on it mind-wise, but my palate sang! Brocoli Salad with Sweet Potato cubes and what tasted like a pistachio pesto! ....to die for! Shared a Lobster --- delicious! To top everything off, we shared Gingerbread Cake (totally delectable) and Three scoops of sorbet (heaven!). We left completely satisfied with our meal, delighted with the service. From the coat-check girl, to the hostesses, to the servers, we were taken care of. All of our needs were met before we knew we had them. Wally, our waiter was so very knowledgeable, his assistant was extremely attentive, ??and though my companion had dined there before, their suggestions in tandem were right on the money. I will definitely return when I'm in the city again!"
4,1,"All we had to eat was the cheesecake. With that being said, there was practically no line at the Times Square location at around 10pm. The cheesecake was delicious! We got the strawberry version and the crust, fruit and cheesy part were amazing. Only criticism would be the syrupy strawberry sauce they use with the fresh strawberries. Not the best."
4,1,"Hola Carino! I had a date here, it was chill & relaxed...and clean. ( i like clean) margaritas...they were awesome and strong..like i like my men. -casual attire, not too loud...dim lighting. wait staff is nice and friendly and attentive too. we both had a good time, i recommend fo sho."
5,-1,Great brunch place!!!! The Lobster Eggs Benedict is delicious. ??Served with lots lobster and a nice side salad also. ??Brunch comes with one drink and was about $16. Will definitely be going back soon.
4,1,"I used to be a monumental Supper fan, now I'm re-evaluating. The ambiance is great and I love that it is always jam-packed (which must mean I'm kind of full of shit right?), but the last few times I've been here it has really fallen flat for me. Maybe it was just what I ordered (Tagliatelle with Bolognese recommended by the waiter). I'm pretty sure I could make that at home and it would taste more interesting. I'm still a fan because of the atmosphere but don't go there expecting the best food experience of your life."
4,-1,"The staff here is so friendly - the hostess, bartenders, servers - all of them! ?? You can see their camaraderie and knack for hospitality shine through in the way they treat both the patrons and each other. ?? The food, every single item, was incredible. I have to recommend the mussels and clams linguini because I devoured them both. The oysters and uni totally worth the wait. Will be back soon."
3,1,"A little disappointment from a place with a high Yelp rank. The place itself is noisy but nice decorated. They have a lot of burgers choices and the burgers are medium size. The prices are 12$-15$ without fries that cost addition of 3.5$-6.5$ and that expensive to my opinion. The service is very good all tough they ruse you to finish your meal and go, so it's not so good if you want to meet with friends. They have a combo meal that is a good deal. The meat of the burger wasn't special for me but the buns are good. In overall a nice place but if you calculate the total with the price I think that there are better burger places."
5,-1,"I have been gluten free for almost 5 months, and dining out has been a nightmare. Bistango offered almost everything on the menu with a gf option - even desert! ??The food was fantastic and was made to order. ??We even had gf bread to dip in the olive oil with fresh garlic before our meal! ??The staff was perfectly attentive, and the owner or manager came out to our table and talked to us about the food. ??We will definitely be visiting again on our next trip into the city. ??Thank you, Bistango!"
1,1,"If you are thinking of stopping in at the cock and bull, my advice is DON""T! I stopped in for a drink on a Friday afternoon. ??The place was virtually empty, and the bartenders still managed to provide poor service. ??The drinks were overpriced and the atmosphere was nothing special. ??Also, avoid the cask beer at all costs, because it was the worst beer I've ever had. ??Personally, I think one star is still too high of a rating for this establishment."
5,-1,My Favorite Restaurant in Little Italy. When I lived downtown I spent a lot of time in Little Italy and have tried virtualy every resturant. Pelligrinos is by far hands down the best. They also have great lunch specials. You have to check it out. AMAZING!
3,1,"Pizza... pretty good. Not like die for amazing...good beer, sometimes kinda flat :( Service sucks all around. Yet for some reason, I always say, ""Oo, yeah let's go to Roberta's!"" And then I do, and it's okay. But awful. I'm conflicted. 2.5 stars!"
3,1,A little upset about not getting the complimentary bread basket with our Saturday brunch. The food was good. The place was packed (to be expected)... definitely recommend reservations. Nice decor.
5,-1,Mother's Day Brunch was fabulous. ??Food was terrific and staff and service could not have been better. ??Doors opening to outdoor sitting allowed our table to enjoy the weather as well.
4,1,"Japanese Tapas for those seeking food other than sushi. Came in on a Wednesday evening and got seated for 2 at the bar. :: Food :: chicken breast w/salt chicken meat ball w/terriyaki beef fillet beef skewers fried tofu agedashi tofu cod fish filet kamameshi daily special fish long island duck Before our order came, they served us a small clump of rice seasoned with the salt. it was really good. As time passed, each plate came and they were pretty small- smaller than expected. Shareable between 2, but no more. The fried tofu was an accidental order as my friend was thinking agedashi (ate it anyways and ordered the agedashi late). Both chicken plates were really good. Each paired well with the seasoning it came with. the plain fried tofu we dipped in leftover terriyaki sauce. the fish fillet was really good and flakey. The kamameshi was tasty though a bit salty. The duck was dry, not the best. :: Service :: Service was pretty good, especially because it was packed and busy. They even cleaned up quickly when I accidentally knocked my glass of water over. :: Ambiance :: Very dark lighting, not too loud- romantic? Very comfortable except that it was too hot in there. Midway through dinner, I was sweating and felt short relief when people would come and leave the restaurant. Overall, it was a great meal. There was still a lot of things to try on the menu. Service is good, ambiance is great. It was nice sitting at the bar and watching them prepare the plates as well as the fresh ingredients lined against the bar. Hopefully its not too hot next time. Definitely recommend ordering the kamameshi as soon as you sit down. It is a bit on the pricey side, but its nice to splurge once in a while for a good meal."
4,1,"love this place! it's much more spacious than the east village location, and every time i've been here finding a seat is no problem. that their wine selections are fantastic goes without saying; food is also very tasty."
1,-1,"we were in Manhattan to eat last week, and this is the place i picked for friday night. ??it seemed to have a reasonable reputation, and i had high enough hopes. ??hopes that were quickly dashed. ?? there was something seriously wrong at the restaurant on this night. ??when all was said and done, we had the distinct impression that several key players at the restaurant had died that very day and had been quickly replaced with local actors. ??no one save the sommelier and one of the side waiters had even the slightest clue what they were doing, and it looked as if the hostess had been crying. we were seated in the lower basement level, and were repeatedly treated to the sound of crashing plates. ??a door opened right onto our table and waiters passing through repeatedly bumped my chair. ??we had ordered the smaller tasting menu, which turned into a three+ hour endurance match. ??wine pairings were ordered with each course, but we had to literally beg to have them brought out - so by the time we got the pairing for the course, the food had been sitting out long enough to become cool from that aforementioned drafty door. course arrivals were spaced out erratically - at first rather quickly, but then with exceedingly long waits in front of empty un-removed plates. the people around us were experiencing similar feats of non-service and were alternately agitated and demoralized by the ordeal. one older gentleman was repeatedly asking for his check - from literally every member of the staff that came anywhere near. ??and it took a good hour before he was finally given it. ??someone involved with the restaurant seemed to know things were seriously screwed up and attempted to assuage every table around us with a complimentary creme brulee.. but this was on top of the already large quantity of dessert course served. ??and the salvers of mignardines and whatnot. ??the food rates the barest of mentions, really. ??as everyone else says, the porcini 'flan' (more of a thickened crab soup really) was pretty good. ??a lobster dish was tasty enough but rather tough. ??a farm egg wrapped in prosciutto was unusual but not particularly appetizing. ??a bit of duck breast was reasonably well prepared. ??wines (late arrivals all) were not bad. but i'm honestly surprised i remember the food at all considering the ridiculously poor service. ?? i am sure that this was a fluke, and that we just arrived on a really bad night. ??but at the prices charged, there should NEVER be a bad night at bouley. ??i sincerely hope no one ever has to live through a meal like this there again."
1,1,"Sincerely has to be one of the worst pizza experiences of my life... First of all, the prices per slice range between 4-5 dollars and pies between 24-30 dollars! The pizza did not taste good, crust was burnt, hard and stale, I'm actually surprised that they actually make it there and that it's not pre-made. Yet again another pizza place that does not live up to it's hype and the outer boroughs still prevail in having vastly superior pizza. Yes, that means the one in your neighborhood and still at an affordable price. The only pros of this place is if you're tired of the regular flavors of pizza they have an interesting combination of flavors, I just didn't like it. I had a margarita slice that was burnt and a artichoke slice that was very weird, to a point that when i threw away my garbage there were two more slices that only had several bites and then discarded. Beware"

5,-1,"I have long been searching for the best pastrami in New York. The search is over. David's Brisket House has the finest pastrami anywhere. I went there with my wife and eldest daughter yesterday. Both are not only seasoned pastrami eaters, but very discriminating in their tastes. They both agreed that this was the best pastrami anywhere. The meat was tender, seasoned perfectly and full of flavor. We also tried the brisket sandwich which will take you back to days gone by. Congrats to David's Brisket House. We will be back regularly."
2,1,"Wooooaahh, hold you horses people. Yes, service was great, but as for the food, I expected better when I saw 4.5 stars. WTF. Opening just three months ago, it must be friends and workers rating this place. I ordered the Distilled Wings, crunchy, great texture, WAY to sweet. Heads up if you're diabetic! My girl ordered the New York Strip Steak. Once the Bone Marrow Black Garlic Butter was gone, the steak was under seasoned and bland. Booo!!! WTF. You spend $28 on a steak you expect a good #$%&ing steak. Pass on this one."
3,1,"What a pleasant surprise! ??It's gorgeous inside! ??I'm a sucker for the sparkly crystal chandaliers that adore the almost Victorian interior with robin's egg blue walls, mirrors and white frames, all of which give this place a feeling unlike most little Thai joints in the city. ??A+ on the cool decor! The food was pretty good too, good pad thai and spring rolls."
4,-1,Best Cuban I've had in the city
2,1,"The service was very friendly and sweet - however the food was disappointing. Very dry, unflavoured tortilla espanola, very dry pimentos de padron and rubbery octopus (the first two of these dishes should be very easy to make and not something they should get wrong). Had a couple of lumps of gristle in my croquettes. The pork meatballs were nice and had a good sauce. Tables, as often in Manhattan, were very very close together. So much so that I had to pull the table out entirely to get to the seat on the other side."
5,1,"For the quality and price, authentic Cantonese food cannot get any better. If you're in the mood for Chinese comfort food like rice porridge, rice noodles with beef, spicy squid, and other special dishes like stir-fried kidney, xiaolongbao, noodles, and pork, this is the place for you. Unlike many other Chinese restaurants in New York, Noodle Village is clean, and its service is fast and always happy to make suggestions. The only thing is that it can get pretty busy, as it's become one of the locals' favorite eateries for amazing Chinese food! Don't settle for the other restaurants in Chinatown; this is one of the rare foodie gems that makes Chinatown worth visiting."
5,1,"Love this place. If you can't eat pork for religious reasons it is really time to rethink your faith. I've had the pork chop - fantastic. Juicy and super tasty. I've had the deviled eggs - some of the best in the city. Most recently I had the chicken (weird I know) but it was really fantastic. What has got me really obsessed with this place is the ""BOULEVARDIER OF BROKEN DREAMS"" (Bacon-infused bourbon, carpano antica, aperol, toasted pecan bitters). Now one of my favorite cocktails in NYC. Great neighborhood, great staff, great food. Cool decor too - lots of punk/alt rock stuff when I was there. Swine not?"
5,-1,I've been to many taqueria and i'm so glad i came across Los Tacos. The price is very tasty and the price is reasonable. I've come here for awhile and i'm always leaving as a happy customer. Their tacos are delicious.
5,-1,"good place, good foods, and good service !!!! Amy is outstanding server!!!"
3,1,"50 bucks worth of salt for two at brunch. Honey latte, could not detect any honey. Biscuits with bacon gravy came out as mushroom, additional up charge for a very good egg and the most salty partially overcooked sausage ever. Wife had some Benedict something, luckily got the sauce on the side as she said it was like a sour habaenero sauce. A large positive was the pork belly/bacon slab, which was beyond perfect. I wasn't even aware it could be prepared as well as it was. Unfortunately that one aspect can't make up for everything. We were the only non hipsters in attendance, so perhaps our expectations are just different. It's Definitely now awful but I doubt I would return based on what we are"
4,-1,"I got here early on a Saturday morning, found it to be just how i wanted: no line, a table available, pleasant atmosphere ! The service was friendly and on point. The food is straight forward and good. No funny garnishes, nothing to mask or hide the main dishes. Great Kale Salad, Lovely and delicious Fuji Apple Mimosa, great Sausage Egg and Cheese sandwich. The coffee is delicious too! I live a few blocks away and this is going to be a go to spot every other week. There are small booths along the back but i think it is best to sit by the window."
4,-1,"Excellent service, good food. Carbonara was wonderful. I hear brunch is excellent at the hotel."
5,-1,"One of the best Japanese restaurants I have ever been in my life. I was amazed by the way how they serve dishes. I felt like I really ended up somewhere in Japan, Good asian design,the high quality of food, japanese looking servers - all these features show top level of this restaurant. I d mention their sushi in particular. Really fresh fish helped me to discern this place among a lot of other japanese restaurants that just serve a fresh looking fish while it is not so. The way the sushi are served is also worth to mention about. It is the whole art to make it like they did. Overall, i would strongly recommend real asian food lovers to visit this place"
5,-1,"First of all, I think atmosphere was very nice. My husband and I were sitting by the bar. Waiter was extremely nice. One of drinks I liked to order was not available, the waiter found a half bottle and asked the manager if we can get the drinks by glasses. Sashimi were fresh and price was reasonable. My husband is Japanese, he enjoyed it greatly. I think it's nice place to hang out."
4,-1,"Holy crap. This place is really good. So good that I may start making pilgrimages to Bed-Stuy just to eat here. So good that I cursed my misfortune that I wouldn't have time to eat here the following day. Yummy, simple drinks on the cheap. Eccentric and sweet service. Awesome music. Number one, though, is that freaking hot chicken. I don't especially love fried chicken. Nor do I especially love extremely spicy things. Yet, I especially love that dish. That with the watermelon salad on the side to take off the heat? A-right."
4,-1,"We ordered delivery through Caviar. We were somewhat skeptical given that we live in Hells Kitchen, but the food arrived fresh and warm within an hour. The Dan Dan noodles were a highlight, they have such a unique flavor. We also enjoyed the three cup chicken and bok choy with black mushrooms."
2,1,"Don't believe the hype...I trusted the previous reviews but maybe I expected too much. Truthfully I think I rather go to golden krust. If dinning in here I would not recommend wearing heels or being over 5'5 , other wise your going to have a hard time getting down the stairs. Don't go before 5 o'clock because only a small portion of the menu will actually be available. I had the oxtails...they were big and lacked flavor, their was no seasoning to me , and not enough gravy. The peas in rice was ok...just ok. I'm glad I tried it , to know that I was not missing out on anything at all."
5,1,Baked Mac and cheese was great great place to grab a bit and relax and chill with friends
5,-1,Best place for sliders and a milkshake in ny. honestly only downside is the small and crowded local. The sliders deserve 5 Stars
4,1,"The best burger in the city, arguably... certainly for the price. Under $7 for a cheeseburger? Open late? $2 McSorley drafts (ok so they're 12 ounces instead of a full pint. But still, TWO BUCKS)? I used to go here almost every night after work, when I worked in the neighborhood. Since the tragic demise of Florent, it's the best after-work-if-you-work-at-night spot in the area... These days I rarely make it that far west, but I've made the trek to Corner Bistro a few times, just because. It's always an experience. There's a waiter (he's a looker; well-built Asian fella) who's the kind of guy you want on your side. Be good to him, and he will always have your back; piss him off, and be very afraid. There's a bartender, white-haired chap; make him smile, and I'll give you a sawbuck. Remember, as other yelpers have said, it's cash only. But take heart: you won't need much cash."
5,-1,"One of my favorite local spots. I'll walk past 5 closer to home to come here. It's a coffee shop and a brunch spot and a bar, all in one. The food is tasty - the menu is wholesome and simple, yet imaginative. The ambiance is great, the decor is artful and budgeted. Nothing too fancy. And they finally got AC! The drinks are great ... and fairly cheap for NYC. $7 for quality classic cocktails. I'm looking at you, Mr. Margarita. Not you, Ms. Old Fashioned. For happy hour, they give you a free shot when you buy a beer ... usually $6. Everyone who works at Skytown is friendly, creative, open. I have yet to have a bad time. Ever. Even sitting by myself. Check it out, and you'll see what I mean. Bottom line: It's a terrific local spot to bring friends, or your parents - for brunch and for late night drinks. Bring your notebook and work for a few hours with a coffee or a beer in the afternoons, if that's up your alley. Been a bunch of times - at this point, it would take a lot to keep me from coming back. Top o' the pops. 5 stars. (Take Briana T's advice - don't order takeout. It's not that kind of place. Sit and be merry, or go somewhere else. )"
5,-1,"Ms. Pervert and I went by yesterday and were totally blown away. Some quick thoughts: - everything was FRESH and TASTY. - everyone was super-nice and happy to answer questions. - as close to West Coast food as I've come in NYC. - very filling without going overboard. - simple and fast. - thankfully, there's nothing pretentious about this place - are you listening rest of the East Village?"
4,-1,Really tasty nachos!! I was vey impressed
5,1,Loved this place! I could tell a lot of people enjoy the food here because literally everyone in the room gave me recommendations when they heard I was a first timer! Really cool experience and really good food! I'll definitely be back! :)
4,1,"Hot food, cold food, snacks, alcohol - this place has it all. It's super convenient and best of all, stays open 'til 3am! It's always filled with people eating snacks, lunch, dinner, and for late night drunk eats. As for the food, it isn't the tastiest (and probably not the freshest), especially compared to all the other restaurants nearby, but it'll most likely be cheaper - especially for the variety. This time, I came here for a drink with a friend. It had beer, sake, soju, bokbunja (raspberry wine), seoljoongmae (plum wine), makgeolli (rice wine), but my friend was craving makgeolli. There was two varieties (yay for choices!). Makgeolli tastes great with sprite! And with saewookkang (shrimp chips), it was a yummy & cheap late night snack."
5,-1,"Prospect does a stellar job of bringing sophisticated cuisine to bustling Fulton Street in a very low key fashion. ??I have now been twice, the day it opened to the public as well as before a concert at Barclay's last weekend. The wait staff is extremely knowledgeable about the food as well as able to crystallize how it was prepared (which helped my friend significantly because he has a very specific food allergy.) There was no lag in my food service and we were in and out in 70 Minutes giving us plenty of time to get to Barclay's. Something i can also say having dined all over, is that my water glass was never empty. This was a small detail that often goes unnoticed but i appreciated it. This new Establishment has hit the ground running in its maiden weeks and I have high hopes for visiting again next week to try their decadent tasting menu. ?? Also, sitting at the counter overlooking the kitchen was a treat. the kitchen is IMMACULATE, and the professionalism is beyond words. I even asked The Chef what he was working on, and he took pause for 30 seconds to explain to me what he was doing. It was a great night. This is a worth wild trip, and also a must return. Perfect Menu: Fois Gras to Start Seafood Bouillabaisse S'Mores (this was a desert special the night I was there truly amazing)"
5,-1,"Went to try this place yesterday and will definitely be back soon! The place was adorable and had so much charm! The food was wonderful! Went to this place with three of my non vegetarian friends and we were all as equally pleased with our meals. I had the roasted artichoke panini which was very good. My friend had the portobello sandwich which was so amazing! Definitely the winner of the night. My other friend had a kale salad which was pretty tasty, Our other friend had the chicken in a garlic sauce, which was so yummy! Unfortunately, her brown noodles had no flavor at all. Aside from that one dish we ??all really enjoyed our meals! I can't wait to check out the tofu scramble for brunch soon!"
4,-1,gotta try this place out! octupus is a must. so is the chocolate mousse!
5,-1,Awesome food served family style. ??I can't wait for my next meal there. Service is like being with a bunch of good friends and family members. ??Their wine list has a number of vintages I'm not familiar with but the recommendations helps out a lot.
1,1,"It really pains me to give this place 1 star but I was so disappointed tonight that I have to. As a total foodie, I had been so anxious to try the burger here and now I know I'll never return. We live in Queens but made a special trip to visit this restaurant because of Yelp and word of mouth. We came on a quiet night so we were seated right away after our friends arrived. The four of us had our cocktails and small apps (the olives and pickles) fairly quickly but we did have a latecomer join us right after we had ordered the small apps. After 3 of us had finished our cocktails and about 15-20 minutes after he arrived a server finally came over to check on us. While this was happening we noticed that one of the employees working in the front was enjoying her dinner at the bar along with a glass of wine- during dinner service in plain view of the diners. Pretty frustrating. After this, we then saw her get back to working. As for the food, we ordered one of everything they had for small and big lots because we had heard so many great things about this place. We ordered two burgers because of all the hype surrounding it. The menu changes regularly and tonight we had a grilled cheese with strawberry jam, an arugula and radicchio salad with goat cheese, roasted carrots and shaved garlic, a cucumber, heirloom tomato and panzanella salad and lastly a melon, padron peppers, crispy bacon and mint salad. The grilled cheese was completely mediocre and too sweet- it would have been a better dessert. The arugula salad was also totally underwhelming and the carrots were way too overcooked and mushy. The panzanella salad was probably my favorite dish of the night- not surprisingly, it was the simplest. The croutons were tasty and although some of the tomatoes weren't as ripe as they should have been (out of anyone's control) it was still very good. The melon salad ruined almost the entire dinner for me and I had just one bite- everyone else at the table seemed to agree with me. The spearmint was so overwhelming for everyone but I made the unfortunate mistake of tasting a pepper, melon, bacon and mint all in one bite. It was so in edible I kept chugging water to get the taste out of my mouth with no luck. Okay, now to the Big lots. We had the burger, the carnitas with pinto beans and tortillas, the pan roasted chicken with creamed corn, and the eggplant and chickpea summer stew. I can only speak personally for the burger. I tried to cut it in half so I could share it with my boyfriend but the bun was so over toasted I had a very difficult time cutting through it. With my first bite, I immediately cut up the roof of my mouth on the bread. The burger was too salty as well. This is coming from a girl who orders her fries extra crispy and loves salt! I was also really sad that I got no duck flavor from the famous duck fat fries. From what my fellow diners said, the chicken was too salty, the eggplant stew tasted like nothing but one spice and had a random fried egg on it, and the carnitas plate seemed like a random afterthought someone threw together. Also, all of the portions besides the burger were huge and was too big for a single serving."
4,1,"This is a new gem on the lower east side. Small restaurant with interesting and eclectic menu. Super drink selection. And the service is dynamite, very personal and inviting (but not cloying). Great place to go with friends to share appetizers and entrees. Very enjoyable place."
4,1,"We went for lunch on a recent Saturday. ??The menu was brief, but had several appealing choices. ??It sounds unoriginal, but I had the burger. ??It was excellent. ??The cheese (not sure what kind) and sauteed onions were perfect. ??The cheese platter our table shared to start had some great choices, but the servings were paltry. ??We had a nice pinot gris to start - it was crisp and refreshing, perfect since the dining room was warm. ??All in all, it was a really nice early summer Saturday lunch. ??Definitely would recommend."
4,-1,"I'm always a fan of this place. Love the vodka sauce and the chicken parm. I wish they gave us wine in real wine glasses -- but that's just a minor detail. Nothing here has changed my life, but it's solid food, and a great place to come with friends, and I'm always excited to come here."
4,-1,"Hey so I'm on a budget. Becco on W 46th street suits me just fine. A $25 Bottle of wine special and a Pasta Price Fix just does the trick for me. Always busy staff is very attentive and if your lucky there is a little balcony in the front on the 2nd floor with a few tables I particularly like. The food is good, remember you can get an all you can eat pasta selection for about $23 dollars."
3,1,"Hm. ??Intriguing theme and fun menu, but as the new restaurant, they seem to have some kinks to work out. Unique decor - keys all over the walls, secrets written in chalk in the bathrooms (you can contribute!), a pair of legs dangling from a wall mount. ??If you're looking for ambiance for scandals and murmurs, this venue fits your mold. Menu - Only ordered drinks. ??Love the creativity with the names ??- ""hot scandal,"" ""david & goliath"" ??The drinks themselves varied greatly in potency though. ??I think they should have had an indicator on the menu because I'm pretty sure one of us was drinking straight tequila through the night. Service - slow for a place at hardly 50% capacity. ??It was their opening weeks, so servers were probably still working out the machines and the mixes (we still tipped decently). But man, orders were slow, drinks were slow, checks were slow."
1,1,"What the??? I went in on a Monday around 1. A lady behind the counter pointedly ignored me, picking up random stuff off the counter instead of making eye contact. After it was clear she was not going to acknowledge me I left. A woman went in right after me and was also ignored. Prices extremely overpriced anyway. $4.50 for a coffee."
5,1,"This place is so freaking cool! It's super cute, intimate and most importantly, delicious! I came here today with a party of 10 for a bridal shower. They put together a family style, prix fixe brunch for our party at $25/pp with unlimited champagne to make bellinis or mimosas with fresh peach juice and orange juice! YUM. The atmosphere here is very neat, pretty typical east village in the fact that it is small. However, they have it set up really awesome. In fact, we had the back private room -- and bonus -- private bathroom! To get here we had to walk through their cool wine cellar. We had the ability to play our own music and decorate the room for the occasion. They have wine bottles everywhere in this place. When you finish your bottle you order, you can sign your name and leave your mark at the restaurant which is a cool idea. On the table when we arrived was bread and yummy beans with olive oil and seasonings. From here, the food didn't stop! We had salad and polenta, omelets, chicken parm sandwiches and french toast! The french toast and chicken parm sandwiches were the biggest hits, but everything was great. OH, and BACON, how could I forget you bacon? I definitely would recommend this spot for a party (remind your party it's CASH only or a % credit card charge!) The deal they provide is awesome and the service was TOP notch. There were 2 or 3 private waiters just for our party and they were friendly and took photos for all of us too! I will absolutely be back!"
5,1,Uva was awesome. It didn't look like much from the outside but as soon as you step through the door you understand why the ratings are so high. The staff was great and the place was sizzling on an extremely snowy night. I am glad we got there early or we would have been waiting a long time for a table. The food was out of this world - even the cappuccino was good! Can't say enough good things. Make sure you go hungry - you won't be disappointed.
5,1,"Who says that the Wall Street area sucks? Me, until I suckled from the fine mozzerella flavored teat of Adrienne's that is... This is my favorite pizza in NY. It's all about the crust. Thin and crisp but also chewy. A revelation for a guy who grew up taking down boxes of Elio's pizza like it payed my allowance. As if delicous pizza weren't enough of a reason to go to a pizza place, when it's nice out they have tons of picnic tables that they share with the other merchants on this block. It feels like a block party (or summer camp) every time you go there. I recently had an important business meeting in the area and despite knowing that it might not be considered appropriate, I brought them to Adrienne's. Hard to say that it singlehandedly won us any business, but at least I got my pizza fix. (scratches neck like a crackhead)."
5,-1,"My son recommended this restaurant. He loves it. ??We were visiting from ou tof state. ??It was beautifully decorated, and the service was very good. My husband loved the salmon, and the other three of us ordered the mezze vegetarian platters. ??They were stunningly presented, in sections divided by nice lemon slices, ??and all of the choices in the platter ??were delicous. The red lentil soup was wonderful, and the baklava and halva for dessert was excellent. This was a wonderful NY experience!"
4,-1,"Yesterday was the third or fourth time we've visited this restaurant during the past year. One thing I can say is that there are no surprises at this restaurant. The food is always good, the fish is done perfectly, and I loved the sheaphard salad grated feta on top. The fish was whole Branzini on the grille. If you like medeterrainian cuisine, you will really like this place."
3,-1,"I am not sure at all about Robataya. I am a recent convert to japanese restaurants in NYC but have been only to two. The two times I have been to Robataya I've gotten there either early enough or snowy enough that the place felt nice, spacious, dark, laid-back, with booths. Familiar Japanese restaurant decor, comfortingly clean bathroom. I came back the second time to get the kamameshi. But now that I've recently come to own a rice cooker and a slow cooker, I am no longer convinced about the unique charms of Robataya's kamameshi. Rather, perhaps rice slow cooked with some stuff you like in it is always delicious. I also don't understand the praise for some grilled vegetables that I feel, anyone can grill. Simplicity aside, sometimes the grilling here feels as though it is evading the challenge that lies in seasoning already good ingredients. The snow dumplings I found particularly disappointing. The pine nuts, fish cake and asparagus appetizer is not bad and displays a kind of thoughtfulness that one senses in general with this place. But I am with the other reviewers who complain that the portions are really astonishingly small here and the meal can easily end up unreasonably pricey. After all, I think this is the kind of restaurant that would benefit for being a place one comes for semi-hearty meals rather than precious ones."
4,-1,Wasn't sure if I was going to like southern food but this place sold me on it. Plus the service was excellent!! Ask for sigon to be your host she was very knowledge of the food and helped me order the perfect meal
5,-1,"Since living in Brooklyn, been here about 4 times. Awesome everytime! Crowded everytime. Worth the trek."
1,-1,"Maialino also deleted my original post!! ??Accept your fate of a 2 star average and stop deleting posts. ??It will be my life's goal to bring the average star rating of this restaurant down. ------ My original post is below: Oh Danny Meyer, if only you knew how horrible some of your wait staff is, you would totally fire their a$$es. I wanted to take my boyfriend out for a nice night after work, so I booked a spot here for Restaurant Week. Little did I know, they didn't have a Restaurant Week Dinner menu. Fine. I'll deal. Our waitress, Guiliana seemed promising at first... Stressing the AT FIRST. We waited 20 MIN until she took our orders. By then I realized she was derping when she scuffled over and squeaked that she ""didn't forget about us."" Ok lady, you were chatting up a storm to the 2 tables next to us. You totally forgot. Our appetizers didn't come out until 20-25 minutes later. The table who sat down before us already had their appetizer come out 10 minutes after we ordered. WUT. When the appetizers finally did come out, they were very underwhelming. The octopus was overcooked and the prosciutto di parma slices were so sad looking. PROSCIUTTO DI PARMA was sad. One of the most glorious cured meats and they managed to make it look sad. 40 MIN LATER... We got our entrees and they were both salty. The squid ink pasta was atrocious and my ox tail parpadelle was over salted. It was so salty that my tongue hurt. At this point, I was starving and ate it only out of necessity. Our waitress totally derped again when getting our check, meaning she didn't even get our check nor did she ask us why my boyfriend's meal was untouched. At this point, my boyfriend called over another waitress who called over the manager and had the horrible squid ink pasta taken off. It's such a shame cause you would think this place would be on par with everything: food, service, hospitality. But we felt rather unwelcomed. The place was filled with a waspy crowd and was very bourgeoise. Bleh. If you're looking for wonderful Italian, go to Osteria Morini. That place has HANDMADE PASTA. Maialino has DRY PASTA. WTF, for the price you're paying, I'd expect freshly made pasta. As Gordon Ramsay would say, ""Wow, what a shame."""
5,1,"This is absolutely one of my favorite places in Brooklyn. Their cocktails are great and comparable in price to other places in the area. The food is always spot on and delicious. And the oysters... Oh, the oysters. Really love coming to Walters with a small group. Their bartenders make great drinks and they're always happy to make you something even if it isn't on the menu. The oysters are definitely some of the stars of the menu at Walter's and the variety of oysters they have here rivals any other place I've been in Brooklyn. There's always been at least 6-8 choices on the menu. The entree menu is regularly changing and while there are some longstanding favorites that seem to have made the cut over the past few years (yum, fish stew!), all of the new items are delicious and well put together as well. I would recommend Walter's to anyone who loves good food and drinks in NY. It is most certainly one of my favorite restaurants. Be prepared to spend a bit when you go here, but also know that it's worth it!"
2,-1,"if you're not Asian, or a slightly underage chubby drunk girl, you don't belong here. ??if you are Asian, you could probably find a better place to hang out. ??If you're a slightly underage chubby drunk girl, this may be a great option for you."
5,-1,one of the nicest ambiance's ever! great food. Great presentation.
4,1,"Comforting and sinfully delicious. A chill environment with traces of trendiness to boot! Went for birthday brunch and tried to behave myself with the roasted cauliflower and apple soup, with a side of the cheddar waffle. The soup was savory, with just the right amount of sweet. Same for the waffles. I LIVED. I'll be back, and soon:)"
4,-1,I've been to Peaches several times since it has been open. ??I'm so glad they opened up in an area that is clearly in need of some decent restaurants. ??The food is consistently good and the staff is friendly. ??The downside is they have consistently slow service too. ??I wonder why after being open a couple of years they haven't improved their speed...
4,1,What a nice surprise to find David's in my neighborhood today. As a lifelong New Yorker there are few things more satisfying to me than a good pastrami sandwich. David's gets two thumbs up for the food. At 10 bucks for a regular sandwich it's a steal too -- would give 5 stars if only they carried latkes/blintzes/other Jewish deli staples.
5,-1,I have been to blend on the water several times and I must say that each time has been an amazing experience!! I usually like to arrive early to my reservations to visit the bar and have some drinks by your amazing bartender John!! He is very welcoming and makes sure his guests are having a great time! One of the many reasons why I enjoy going to blend is to have John mix up drinks for me and my friends for some good laughs and fun. All of the waiters and waitresses have enthusiastic energy and keep the fun going once we're seated!
1,-1,"This was the worst experience EVER! ??I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. I took 47 students to this place yesterday for a class trip and not only did they not have a record of the reservation that I made over 2 weeks ago with the pre-ordered food choices, but they practically threw the food on the tables, NO WHITE RICE (I never heard of that!), NO tea, fingers in water glasses, filthy bathrooms, and unhappy waiters. ??They were not attentive, or nice to my group of foreign students. The waiters wouldn't even bring more water unless I asked. ??I got the feeling they wanted us in and out---take the $$ and get us out of there! The food wasn't even that good either. I thought that when they realized that they screwed up the reservation they would have gone overboard to satisfy a customer who was bringing them of over 500$ worth of business...they did not! Additionally, I was quoted a price of 11.5 a person which I thought was very high for the amount of food we got. ??I usually order a meal from other restaurants that is about 8$ and eat barely half...This place charged more and gave us less! ??Go somewhere else if you have a choice!!!!!! I'm, still mad at myself for leaving a tip!"
3,1,"First time trying this place today, we made reservations so we managed to avoid the long line of wait. The food is mediocre, but for all you can eat it included crabs and shrimp which i thought was a pretty good deal. They serve the most watered down herbal tea i've ever had...probably cause it was free (but they might as well serve water cause thats what it tasted like) The waiters were really friendly brought us our food quick and joked around with us. Came here only for the hotpot, i know they have some sort of korean bbq too but i didn't get a chance to try it, their tomato soup base was decent.. and their fried tofu skin was good.. generous portions! Pros: quick service, generous portions, check-in for free ice cream, free dinner on your birthday must show ID Con- limited items on their menu, the good stuff like cuttlefish balls are 3.99 extra (WHOAS i can buy a whole bag myself outside) :/ Final thoughts- i would come back only for my birthday, mister hotpot definitely has more options and tasted alot better, and another cheaper alternative for mister hot pot would be hi pot on 18th ave...so with all the options available nearby i'd definitely consider other options before comming back to this place."
3,1,"Cafe Ghia is a good neighborhood addition. Still needs some improvement*** but they are definitely on the right track. 3.5 stars! I first came here for dinner and thought it was okay. The tuna melt sandwich tasted good with a right amount of ingredient ratio and flavor balance. However, my friend's vegan club was not as successful. It was painful to see the difficulty she had biting through the over toasted bread. Had there been a touch more tahini dressing, it would've slightly moistened the bread and add flavor. My second visit, this time for brunch, was a lot more pleasant for the following reasons: - We did not have to wait long at 1PM - While outside, we saw someone walk out of a community garden with a hand full of freshly harvested herbs run into the restaurant. What's it for? Certainly not for decor. - Bottomless strong cup of coffee. ??We inquired where it's from and server shyly admitted not knowing but mentioned it's been dubbed ""kick ass"" - Server checked on us often without being overbearing and even apologized when our orders were slightly behind. - All of us enjoyed the food - french toast, BLT panino and my order of daily scramble of zucchini and cherry tomatoes. ??Quality ingredients, when prepared with care and simplicity are always a winner in my book. I'll give dinner another shot for sure. See you there! ***Let's face it, there is always room for improvement. ""Good, better, best; never let it rest till your good is better and your better is best."""
5,-1,"Quality french food with a friendly attitude. I am originally from France and I discovered cafe Triskell through a friend who has often visited France. It was a great discovery since most of the french restaurant in the city are not the true reflection of what a restaurant is in France. This one is the case. Great and diverse food in a very relaxed and friendly atmosphere. The lobster and shrimp risottos are to die for. Add a crepe for desert and you have a very nice culinary experience without breaking the bank. Moreover Chef Philippe Fallait is not afraid to share some of his cooking tips. I go there frequently and recently have tried his foie gras that I have to say was one of the best I have ever tasted. The service is done with by the very friendly wife of Philippe and Mary who make you feel at home right from the moment you enter. Go there a second time and you become friends, a third visit you are family. A true unknown little jewel at the heart of Astoria. Not to be missed..."

5,-1,Awesome Burgers great atmosphere love it
5,1,"Old-time Chinatown, lots of atmosphere, waterglasses for tea, busy dining room. ??EXCELLENT food, top- quality ingredients, talented chefs, true regional seasonings for gourmands. Had the pork chop with onions platter, A+. ??Chinatown-style Young Chow Fried Rice to dream about, Sliced Sirloin with Chinese Vegetables, fresh spring and egg rolls, and mei-fun noodle soup bowls with duck and roast pork and seafood special. ??Everything was outstanding, bill was way under $100 including tax and tip and fed six people to bursting. Time-of-day can have you waiting on lines out the door, Chinatown traffic and parking is a hassle, but as always, the food here is simply worth the trouble. ??And at the price, it is downright incredible."
5,-1,"Probably my favorite NYC restaurant. They just do everything right here. Amazing atmosphere, amazing food, amazing jukebox. Worth waiting for. Highly recommend the burger, the kale and the gumbo. With NY becoming more and more ""posh"", these places become more and more valuable."
5,1,"You have to know and appreciate authentic Japanese food to truly enjoy the food here. ??Don't expect the ""Americanized"" sushi, terriyaki, etc. ??The portions are smaller, but if you go with a larger group, you can try an array of dishes. ??Drinks are overpriced and if you know that going in, you won't get sticker shock when you see the tab. ?? ??Keep in mind that the cheapest sake is $22 and there's no wine. ??You may want to enjoy the impeccable food and have drinks somewhere after dinner. The dishes are clean, exquisite, and perfectly seasoned. ??Sashimi was amazingly fresh and robust with flavor. ??All of the dishes were unique and tasty. ??The pork is amazing (with or without the yummy fat layer on top)."
5,1,Last night was my second visit to Salinas and it was very good - the food and service are amazing. ??The one peeve I have is the octopus. ??I had it the first time at 10pm at night in June - sent it back - it was like rubber - thought it was a late Friday night slip up.. ??The wait staff agreed and said the kitchen apologized - offered a replacement dish but I declined and shared my friend's tapas which was excellent (like everything else). ?? Went back last night (early evening Thurs) and ordered the octopus- it was better - not great and still not tender. ??I guess I've been spoiled by Bobby Flay's former Bolo or the top Greek restaurants in NYC that really tenderize their octopus. ??I still had to do some major chewing on this octopus and my bf tasted it an agreed. ??I didn't send it back - it wasn't awful but wasn't great. ?? The special Red Snapper was fantastic and the coconut rice pudding is very good. ??Love their red sangria and drinks and the staff is over the top amazing and attentive. Will go back soon.
4,1,"We're pretty much regulars of the brunch menu, and have tried the dinner here a few times. ??Consistent good solid food, and it's just down the street (bonus for those that live in Brooklyn Heights). ??Cuisine is American. My suggestions: * Eggs Benedict (and their speciality - the Orleans, which has fried oysters as the meat). * Cheesy grits (seriously good). Can't beat a place that's consistently good/solid food."
3,1,"A pretty good place to visit in you are craving some Mapo Tofu. ??Service is decent, but not spectacular. ??Fortunately, the tasty good makes up for it. ??There is a minimum of $18 in order charge your meal onto a credit card."

4,-1,"My husband and I came for dinner on a Friday night. We did not have reservations and boy was ??I sorry I didn't make one. Next time i will call and make one for sure. The 2 friendly hostesses told me it would be a bit of a wait but the cute tapas bar in front made the wait totally pleasurable. The best part about our wait was the talented bartender who knew exactly what we needed. Best drink have had in a long time! The hostesses came to take us to our table and we were almost sad to leave the bar. But once we walked into the dining room we were pleasantly surprised. Beautiful atmosphere, great service that's just the right amount of attention, and the food was amazing. TimeOut NY was spot on with their assessment of the rosejat rapido. It deserves best dish in NYC for sure! I could eat this dish every day. It can get a tad loud but this is NY after all and it's always a good feeling to be in a busy place. So I can deal with it happily. All in all Salinas is a great place and I can't wait to go back!"
5,1,"I've only been to Maialino for brunch, but it is definitely one of the top brunch spots in the city. ??The location can't be beat, as is sits inside the beautiful Gramercy Park Hotel in a secluded yet very convenient area of Manhattan. ??The restaurant itself is beautiful - it's very light and airy, and is has a bustling feel without being crowded. ??The menu has a lot to choose from, and everything I've tried is incredible. ??All of the breakfast pastries are fresh and delicious, and you can tell they are baked in-house. ??The eggs, sides, and pancakes are equally delicious. ??The menu also has many lunch dishes that I've never tried but look great and are probably closer to the dinner menu, including pastas and sandwiches. ??It is the kind of restaurant you'll want to linger at, and it is perfect for a special occasion. ??Brunch gets busy, but making a reservation is not a problem."
4,1,"Great food. Great service. Went there at 8pm on a Friday night and was seated immediately. We ordered a delicious artichoke appetizer, which came out in a very timely manner. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, and very quickly replaced my wine when I noted that the glass was dirty. I had a daily special of pappardelle with roasted tomatoes and ricotta. It was delicious and a very decent portion. All the ingredients were fresh and ??flavorful. Even the bread and parsley/olive oil sauce they provided as a complementary appetizer were delicious. One downfall - the restaurant is cash only. I will definitely go back there again."
4,1,"delicious. - the wait isn't that bad. have a cocktail while you wait. if you're hangry, you can order appetizers to level out your blood sugar level prior to being seated - appetizers: everyone goes shit shit crazy over the buns. which is fine- not the best i've tried, but tasty nonetheless. but i LOVED the ika with brussel sprouts and potato chips. sounds weird, but you really don't know how perfect this appetizer is until you taste it for yourself. honorable mention: flash fried shishito peppers - ramen: the karakamen (spicy miso) was very good, but i also tried the shiromaru hakata classic (i'm a purist haha) and the broth was really exceptional: clean with amazing depth. great meal, nice ambiance. you feel like a rockstar when the whole restaurant greets you as you enter and thank you when you leave."

Speak loudly to us in a bad mood; never come to refill our hot tea; one of our food is simply forgot to put in; urge us to pay tips. It's the worst experience for us to be in New York last time. I will never come to this restaurant!!!!!!"
5,-1,Great place for tacos! ??Huge tacos for 3 for $6. ??The fajitas are awesome too....use big bold peppers and mushrooms .....one of my favorite places in the city since la fonda on 103rd closed down. ??I hope they add chiliqulies to the menu at some point....also I always get extra black beans....don't know why they are soooo good but they are. Ordered delivery once and they messed up the order......sent the guy right back with a free bottle of orange soda....don't you miss customer service. Also I see a couple of bad reviews......if you are a white boy living in chelsea who went to colby college or bucknell and think mexican food is taco bell or on the border or cheddar/ 8 cheese and cheese whiz filled quesidillas from Chilis..........well you just wasted money on your Groupon friend. If on the other hand you actually know that tacos are soft shelled and not topped mountain dew sauce than this is the place for you. ??It is a better take out/delivery place than a place to have a nice sit down dinner........maybe in a few years when they expand!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,-1,Stopped by and had Turkish Coffee not only was it great but the owner was warm and friendly. They have a B.Y.O.Bottle policy that will make taking ??friends there even better. Love that it was super clean and that they have Baklava too!! Will be bring visiting family there for sure!
3,1,"I think I'm coming to the conclusion that I want to like Sweet Afton more than I actually do. ??It's not that the place is bad...and it's certainly a welcome change of pace for the neighborhood from the dozens upon dozens of sports bars and euro-club type establishments...but just because it's different doesn't automatically make it good. ??Further, as someone who spent the better part of the last decade living in Brooklyn, I think I was initially suckered in by the whole ""a little taste of Brooklyn here in Queens"" comment that is rampant on this website, and has been expressed to me by (Astoria-dwelling) friends & acquaintances as well. ??Really though, this is nothing like Brooklyn bars...at least not the ones that I used to frequent in Greenpoint, Williamsburg, Fort Greene, Cobble Hill, Clinton Hill, Park Slope, etc...you get the point. ??It's still very Queens-y...and I can't quite put my finger on how...but it just is. The beer selection is decent. ??The cocktail menu seems to be trying a bit too hard, but what I've tried from it I've liked well enough. ??The food, once again I'm stuck repeating myself and saying that it's kind of meh. ??The space itself is warm and inviting, though feels a bit unfinished. ??All in all, it has all of these positive attributes that I like in an establishment, but all of them come with caveats. Also, and this is at least partially my fault, as I should've been more diligent paying my tab, but they totally overcharged me last evening, and I didn't realize it until I was halfway home (almost a mile away), and given how cold and windy it was, I wasn't about to turn around and go argue over a few bucks. ??But a mac n cheese plus 1 beer should've been in the $16 range. ??How my tab grew to $23.95, I can only guess. ??The bartender seemed like a nice enough fellow, and I'm not implying that he purposefully tried to scam me or anything...probably just simple human error...but still, it kind of irks me when places rip me off (intentionally or not)."
4,1,"Freeman's is a great place for drinks. The service was genuinely friendly and our server very knowledgeable. Dinner was just okay, I ordered the - Hot Artichoke Dip with Crisp Bread ($12) and it was good, seemed more promising in the menu. Another slight disappointment were the mussels in paprika mayonnaise ($15), again, not bad, just okay- maybe they need to cook with just a bit more love? On the bright side, their 5 cheese macaroni ($15) was exquisite as well as the grilled pork loin ($26). I'll certainly be coming back to their bar and enjoying a good drink, in a great ambiance with good service."
1,-1,"I'm usually satisfied with this place, but today the ""manager"" was very rude to us. We were a party of 5, waiting for 30 minutes to get a table. First, they didn't make any effort to accommodate us, and were filling the large tables with couples, but that wasn't as bad as their attitude. After 30 minutes of wait the ""manager"" asked us to wait outside, and we asked to stay inside because it was windy and still cold. She said that we should leave then. That was really rude and inappropriate, because we are regulars and would wait longer to get seated. Dissapointed."
2,1,"I always give restaurants the benefit of the doubt so I will complete this review after I return for a second time but my initial visit was disappointing to say the least. As another reviewer pointed out, the arroz caldo is quite diluted and lacked the balance between the punch of the garlic and the sweetness of the ginger that defines the dish. I also ordered the tortang talong which is an eggplant omelette with sauteed tomatoes and onions that had many problems. The eggplant was far too soggy, the eggs lacked any flavor which was unacceptable, and the tomatoes and onions contributed to the mucky meal. There was a pool of liquid that formed at the bottom of my plate from how drenched the dish was. However, I did enjoy the ube waffle. That's the lone bright spot of my day there. The prices were extremely high and the food I had was sub-par which was not a good combination. I'll give it one more try though because I hate leaving a place with a negative lasting image."
4,-1,"Love this darling little restaurant! Love Didier! I was in NY for a long weekend celebrating my birthday back in October and insisted on visiting this restaurant while there. ??(Based on reviews I had read). Simply delightful. Didier and the hostess whose name escapes me at this moment were absolutely wonderful, warm and welcoming. The food was delicious and portions were quite large. The ambience was perfectly SoHo fringe (what I love and miss about living in NY). I was wistful as our meal progressed...Wishing I still lived in NYC so that I could frequent this little gem. Hugs & Bisous, Didier! ;o) p.s. - be sure to bring a bottle of wine or bubbly to enjoy with dinner!"
5,-1,"If you're a vegetarian, this may be paradise for you as it is for me. The food is fantastic! I can never get tired of their beets salad, and their poikilia, which are three dipping sauces, they are to die for. Their service is also great. They are usually so busy during the end of the week so you might need to call ahead of time to make reservations."
4,1,"I stumbled into this place with my roommate after a long day of shopping. We got carne asada tacos, which were more like tortillas stacked with so much meat and guac that you can't even fold it. The meat was perfectly tender and flavorful, and one taco was the exact right amount to hold me over until dinner. Beware of the hot sauce - they weren't lying when they say its HOT. The initial burn subsides after the 2nd or 3rd bite, but an hour after we ate I could still feel it in my tongue."
4,1,Came here with my gf for lunch on a Saturday around 4pm. Pretty packed at this place. We each got the classic Vietnamese sandwich and iced Thai tea. Food was good. Willing to come back here again if around the area.
4,-1,Delicious food but super expensive. It was great and staff were very attentive but for three of us with no drinks it was $300!
4,1,"I'm new to the neighborhood and Tom's has already become a go-to breakfast/brunch place. I generally go earlier on weekend mornings (around 9am), so I've never had to wait. How do they get their pancakes to be so fluffy and moist, yet not too dense?! I love, love, love their lemon ricotta pancakes, but I also have love for their sweet potato pancakes. Have them with a side of pork sausage. Juicy but not too greasy or salty, and it's oh so good together. I wasn't crazy about their crab cake benedict. The crab cakes were way too bready, but I guess I should've expected that."
5,-1,"As a beer guy who spends hours a week searching out the best places to find and enjoy beer my expectations run high....Rattle 'n' Hum never disappoints. From one of the best and most complete craft beer lists to the quick service even when it is packed, this place is a must to get to and enjoy! Be back soon for sure!"
3,-1,"I work in the LES, so of course I make my way here and come with my co-workers. I soon found out this place gets packed and has a lot of buzz. But I don't understand why. The food is good, sometimes very good, but not great! Not sure, what people are raving about in their reviews. Maybe, its comfort food and the nostalgia and good feelings that come from it, but on pure quality of the food, its enjoyable, but nothing to rave about. And if a coworker says lets go to Clinton, I would be up for it, they do know how to cook an egg properly!"
4,1,"Good noodles. Quick, warm and spot-on service. Only complaint is that they always keep a server overlooking the dining area adjacent to the entrance...given that it is a small and quiet space it makes me feel being watched,especially if you are dining alone. Ask to be seated at the bar or in the corner you will be fine."
5,-1,Best French Toast On Earth! ??Need I say more?
4,1,"I had reserved a pound of brisket what seemed like an eternity ago, but Saturday I finally got out to Delaney BBQ. We arrived (barely found the place because they don't even have a sign outside!) around 615 PM. ??There was already a line 8 people deep. The line moved a bit slowly but we eventually arrived a the counter to claim our prize. We chose 1/2 lean and 1/2 fatty brisket and 4 ST Louis ribs. The lean brisket had a nice taste but was a bit on the dry side, whereas the fatty side was much nicer, and flavorful. There was a thick bark on the edges and the rub wasn't overpowering and it had a hint of black pepper. The ST Louis ribs were quite good and also had a good smoke ring. For sides we chose red cabbage coleslaw and German potato salad. Each of the sides were very good. They even have Mexican coke! ??I wanted to order a second one and one of the staff said he would get one. When he returned he was apologetic about the waits so he comped us! ??That was unexpected. Be forwarded the seating is quite cramped and on the dark side. ?? It is worth the wait...oh and they're slogan is perfect. ""Fat is the new black!"""
5,1,"I really couldn't ask for a better neighborhood restaurant. ??The hot fried chicken with a side of bacon creamed corn and a Mother's Milk stout is one of my favorite meals in the city. ??Service can be a little slow sometimes, but is always exceptionally friendly and the food is worth the wait. ??They also have a great selection of New York beers for $4 or $5 and a solid cocktail menu. ??The atmosphere is charming and they're always playing an excellent selection of soul and blues. ??Really just an all-around great place which I consistently recommend to all of my friends."
3,1,"We were not overly impressed with this meal. I had a Gorgonzola and cherry pizza which was nice, but nothing amazing. The atmosphere was a bit uncomfortable. The music was insanely loud and we were sat at a table in the centre, which made it hard to chat. We finished our meal, and everything was ok, but at $70 for two pizzas and a bottle of wine, I left feeling underwhelmed. Service was friendly and prompt."
5,1,"Great food, great ambiance. The dining space is divided into several rooms so it has a small feel, yet they haven't crowded the tables in there so it has a relaxed feel. Service is reasonably prompt, the menu is diverse, and everyone at my table enjoyed what they got for lunch. It wasn't too busy, for lunch on a Friday anyway."
3,1,"Pretty neat idea. An extension of a poutine you might get in Canada. Staff very friendly but the place is very obviously still in the opening phase. ??Our dish (smashed hit) was tasty but the girl preparing it put way too much garlic! ??Be on the lookout for that. Funny enough they ask if s&p on your potatoes is ok, but don't ask before they pile a tablespoon or two of raw minced garlic."
4,1,"Briciola is the perfect place for a quiet happy hour. The space is intimate (read: suuuuuuuuuuuuper tiny) with a long bar or community table. If you have agoraphobia, definitely stay away. Lined by walls of vino and votive candles, you'll feel as if you've been transported into the most beautiful of basements. The food and drinks are relatively inexpensive, albeit delicious. The burrata will melt in ??your mouth (but not as much as I would)."
5,-1,"Meme is fantastic! Amazing food, prices, and service."
4,-1,"There's a reason for the long lines but the despite the wait, the fresh and delicious quality of the food makes the wait worthwhile. Prices are reasonable but not ideal. Service can sometimes carry attitude but at the speed and volume of the server's days at this non-stop restaurant, one may cut them some slack and be back for more."
3,1,"Yahoo! Ground zero for NYU late-night cheap-eats offers palatable (if not a little pricey at $8 a pop) banh mi, pho, and basic beers. A convenient dash from Off the Wagon. Does not accept credit cards."
5,1,"The staff were super friendly, the food was good and the meal was very affordable. If I lived in NYC, I would definitely return."
5,-1,"Took my wife here for a birthday brunch. It was a saturday so it wasn't a full brunch menu but we mixed and matched together a great meal, finished off with a sublime warm donut. Service was so professional and warm and the bill was very fair. Going back real soon!!!"
5,1,"Definitely one of the best meals I've ever had. And it's actually a good value considering that food and service at this level is typically 1.5-2x more expensive. We had: Monkey bread (the butters are incredible) Oysters w/ frozen verjus (the verjus takes oysters to another level) Carrots (favorite smaller plate) Tuna crudo (very good but felt like it might have been missing one additional flavor) Rohan duck (best duck I have ever had. The jujube sauce is unreal) Ice creams (salted caramel, egg nog, white coffee, all very good) Sommelier actually recommended a bottle of champagne to go with our choices (I can't drink red), which turned out to be a great selection that really enhanced the flavors of everything. Service was top-notch. Only other restaurant I have been to with this kind of service is Gramercy Tavern. Very helpful, down to earth, always there when you need something..only great things to say about the service."
4,-1,"I've been living downtown in the Financial District for over a year now and Blue Spoon coffee has been my perfect go to coffee place. They brew good coffee and during the weekdays you can get sandwiches, soup, or salad (although I would opt for the soup they always have delicious flavors and variety) The only red flag I throw is the credit card minimum of $4.00...makes it tough to get coffee on the go if you don't have cash."
5,1,"I came here with my girlfriend after doing a manhattan wide search, of a random cuisine, we chose Thai. Among the top ranking places was Room Service. After taking the train here, and walking in through the front doors, I was blown away by the interior (maybe a tad bit too many mirrors, but it's okay) and atmosphere and especially its combination with the prices! I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai, with spring rolls and my girlfriend ordered the Pad See Euw, with vegetable dumplings. The Pad Thai was definitely one step above the average, but not the best one i've seen, and I will continue to look for it. The spring rolls were good, and the vegetable dumplings weren't a personal favorite. However, the Pad See Euw was amazing. The noodles were fantastic and the sauce with it amazing. The prices were simply amazing ($6.90 for my girlfriend's dish and $7.90 for mine), making it a 5-star restaurant. I'm really looking forward to my next visit here! (i want to try the basil noodles) Where else can you go for such a delightful combination of prices, food, and ambience?"
5,1,"Boyfriend and I went towards the end of a self-guided Chinatown tour. ??We shared an order of the stir-fried hand-pulled noodles with vegetables. ??Could've been a little less greasy, but everything else was spot-on. ??Noodles were perfect-- so chewy/QQ (all the Q's!), the occasional thin strand that screams 'handmade', good amount/variety of vegetables. ??No-nonsense but friendly service and was fun to watch the guy pulling the noodles in the back. ??Cheap. ??Five stars for overall experience; wish I lived in New York..."
5,1,"This is my favorite ramen spot in NYC, hands down. ??And, to counteract what one of the reviewers said in regards to there being no Asians there, I'm 100% Asian and go there more often than I'd like to admit. ??In fact, I'm Korean, and I love their Kimchi Ramen. ??It's not like I'm really starved for Kimchi, either (I hit up Flushing at least a few times a month)...it's just really good. ??I mean, it's spicy as all hell (to non-spicy eaters), but it's delicious. ??Everytime I go there, I really WANT to order the other ramen...but it's kimchi ramen...and I'm Korean. ??I can never bring myself to order anything else. I will say that my fiance (who's possibly the most picky eater I've ever met) loves the veggie ramen, and never finishes it. ??Therefore, I end up with the best of both worlds (and the worst of one): ??I get to each both the kimchi ramen, and her remaining veggie ramen, then pay for it for a few hours as I end up being way too full. Favorites: Kimchi Ramen Veggie Ramen Brussel Sprouts Kale Salad Chicken Wings Pork Buns Whenever we go there, the brussels and the kale salad are a must, which further explains why I feel sickly full after every visit. ??I'm always tempted to order the wings and the pork buns, too, but I really can't justify two bowls of ramen and 4 appetizers between the two of us. ??Plus, I just might end up killing myself by eating so much. The wait is LONG...it's true. ??The great part (as some have said) is that they will take your phone number and call you when your table is ready. ??Additionally, if you go across Vanderbilt to Woodworks, they will give you $1 off well drinks and draft beer, but you have to tell them you're waiting for Chuko. To those of you who have complained about there being a wait at a restaurant in Brooklyn: ??keep in mind that it's not the restaurant causing the wait. ??The staff moves very quickly to get people in and out of the door as fast as possible. ??It's all about the laws of supply and demand. ??If nobody went there, there would be no wait. ??Therefore, if you don't want to eat there, don't...you'll be just making it easier for others to get seated faster. ??In other words, there's a pretty clear reason why people are forced to wait."
3,-1,"We dined at 530 as we have a 1 year old future foodie. My wife and I both wanted to love this place as we were both fans of dovetail. Service was impeccable and they were incredibly attentive and thoughtful. Started with the oysters which were delicious. Oysters perfectly baked and the crumb delivered as a tasty contrast. The lamb was cooked perfectly but was nothing out of this world. The roast chicken could have been out of this world - comforting, delicious and downright craveable. Unfortunately it was a tad heavy on the salt for us. Still - we would be willing to give it another visit should we get a chicken and truffle broth craving. 3 stars on this visit."
4,1,"Solid four stars, good food so far I can complain and the staff are doing good job. We were there with a big group of 40 ??people and I have to say they have met our expectation. As regular to this place we will still be regular, Grazie a Emporio."
5,1,"Went here for my birthday last night. ?? LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place! ??Everything was excellent, two bottles of Moutard Grand Cuvee, the oyster bar, fish dishes, and the desserts/lattes. ??Fantastic! ??The waitstaff is smooth and friendly, even as they have to crush through the bar with food for those of us who were lucky to score a booth, and even though they were hopping, somehow someone told them it was my birthday and they brought me a dessert with a little candle on it. ??A very nice, unexpected touch. ??There was absolutely no rush to our meal, and wound up dining for about 2.5 hours. ??Pacing and food was great! When I can save up some more sheckels, I will definitely come back...I have been wanting to come here for years, and it was totally worth the wait. ??At least I can stop by and buy some of the best bread I've ever eaten in NY at their bakery. ??Four thumbs up!"
4,-1,Great Burritos! Lines can get a little long(but move quickly) but can never get a seat.
5,1,That was my first stop in New York and I have never tasted anything like it ! The shawerma's are awesome and the falafel is probably better than the ones in the Middle East!
5,1,"SO THRILLED to stumble upon this hidden gem while working a temp job on Wall Street today! I used the Yelp $5 for $10 deal and even without it, everything is pretty reasonably priced. I got their green smoothie with almond milk and a side of roasted sweet potatoes. Not only were these items delicious, but it's dinner time and I'm still full. Which is great for me! Added bonus, they have all their calorie content posted online!"
4,-1,You can easily miss the place if you don;t know your way around! Great atmosphere:live music nearly every night. Good menu and wine list. Small but cozy. Excellent date cake. Cash only.
2,-1,"Yes, the portions are enormous and almost everyone takes lots home.......Yes, there is always a wait. We waited an hour and fifteen minutes for a table for two at 5:30 on a Saturday night. Yes, they offer free house wine to those who are waiting.....and yes the meal concludes with a bonus, custard desert. As for the food....it was average at best. The half a loaf of crispy, warm Italian bread was sopping in oil.....The peasant salad was OK but nothing extraordinary.....The fried calamari was chewy and the chicken kebab was overcooked and charred.The lemon potatoes were horrible........Would we ever return again.......absolutely not."
5,1,"So glad I found these guys...bottom line great panini's, awesome crapes and above all great friendly service. I love seeing new small business take pride in their craft and they do so here. Have been here 3 times already and it has been consistanntly good :)"
3,1,Everything was nice and fresh but they were a little skimpy on the guar. I personally think chipotle has better flavor but this place is still a great alternative and I wouldn't be unhappy eating it any day.
4,-1,"I am giving BLEND ON THE WATER 4 stars because they have amazing food and service as well. My server Alex Sanchez was a very sweet tiny waitress who took the time out to point us in the right direction from the moment we arrived. Everything she recommended was great and her drink choice 'Sangritas' was truly amazing. My friends and I were very happy with her service she was friendly, funny and definitely made us feel comfortable. That actually made us not even realize how long the food took. I will be back and hoping to be seated with her again. Many Thanks Alex!"
1,-1,"Worst service in Chinatown for OK food . Chinatown service is usually efficient - (fast, no small talk, etc. I can deal with it). But the waitstaff here was downright RUDE - (i've been here a few times but this was definitely the last). The waitress was absurdly aggresive and antagonistic to my family. In all my years of eating in Chinatown - this was hands down the WORST SERVICE ever (and that's quite a statement, haha). What kind of establishment allows their waitstaff to scowl and yell at patrons when they're putting in an order? It was super weird and super rude - apparently we didn't order enough food? we don't know- either way, it was uncalled for. All in all, the food is decent Chinese fast food - but not worth the stomach churning service. Not worth it to ruin your visiting out-of-town family's meal with waitstaff who give you attitude It's worth it to trek a few extra blocks to Congee Bowery or Congee Village (most of my HK friends agree that this is less touristy - albeit less centrally located - and the food is better quality and less expensive) from now on. Better selection of authentic chinese dishes, efficient (though still not entirely friendly - but not rude either) service, and better congee (great consistency, lower price too), solid won ton noodle soup."
5,1,Amazing burger great service with cheap beers and I heard Rapoza drinks here so it must be cool.
4,1,"This crepe cafe is cute, casual, sunny, relatively quiet, and has good food at decent prices. I'm not sure how authentically french this place is, but they serve up very good looking brunch/breakfast food. I got the salmon crepe with basil cream (give me more creeeeaaaammm, mmmmm). ??Went with a couple coworkers, and the place provided a nice relaxing atmosphere for us to loosen up and chat. A good sign -- everyone finished everything on their plates. Good soundtrack too. Johhny Cash's cover of NIN's Hurt.. and then an entire Bob Marley album. Oh yes. Me likey."
1,1,"This used to be a great brunch place in Astoria but not anymore. The service stinks -- waited 45 minutes for an omelette and some pancakes before just abandoning ship. ?? On a prior visit, the OJ was not fresh, but some concentrate crap (I saw the bartender mixing it), the salad was not even washed (it had bits of a plastic bag that was ripped open) and the quiche was half hot and the other half cold (a poor reheat job). ?? I'm done with this place."
5,-1,"I thoroughly enjoyed this place. ??I had stuffed shrimp, wonderfully done. ??My wife had the scallops (tasty and tender), and my son had sausage (cooked just right and also tasty and tender). ??Great atmosphere, fast service and a really cool neighborhood. ??Stop by for a meal before heading to LaGuardia for a flight."
5,-1,"This place is phenomenal! I'm not sure why they are getting such horrible reviews. Yes, it is new and they don't take reservations and they clearly have a few kinks to work out in the seating department. So go there prepared to wait, have some drinks and oysters at the bar. It is absolutely worth it... the food was incredible and the staff was super friendly, the chef even came out to check how everything was after the meal. The seafood was so fresh and delicious, I will no doubt be going back again. The peel and eat shrimp were perfection! We ordered snow crab legs which were great, as were the fried clams, creamed spinach and crab cakes. The blue crabs were pretty good too, but not the best I've eaten. Everything was reasonably priced, and given the outrageous prices for seafood in New York, I'd say this place is great deal. ??All in all, I had a great experience. Just go there ready to wait and it'll be all good."
5,-1,"we love to pop in for late lunches when you can easily get a table. Wish i was inside every time i walk the dog past their window! If you haven't been, you gotta go!"
3,1,"Not sure the fuss about it! My sister loves this place. It is her must go place when she comes to NY. For me... just this time maybe (too much calorie consumed in one snack). The portion is generous, the fries are good (a little salty especially with sauce), but not as special as I expected. The place is small and the seats are limited, easily to get crowded."
5,-1,"Totally classy update of the venerable Village restaurant. ??Wonderful food, service and decor."
5,-1,"Only got $5, come here and get full. The owner is a class act. Eating here since it open."
5,1,Really awesome lunch for the price. ??A real meal. Baked chicken. Yellow Rice. Red beans. Lemonade. :kisses fingers:
3,1,"I'm teetering between a 3 and 4. If I were writing this Adam Platt of New York mag-style, I'd say one star for the ambiance, another for the service (seated promptly -- check, friendly and unpushy waiter -- check, constant water refills -- check), and one for the divine lemon foccaccia bread ??+ the heavenly sheep's milk herb ricotta that everyone's already raved about on Yelp. What's preventing me from giving Locanda Verde a solid 4 stars was the unmemorable poached cod, and the almost-great-but-not-quite-there gigantone pasta with duck, which our waiter heartily recommended. Side of organic spinach with dried chickpeas: decent but not spectacular. We were also a bit disappointed at having to miss out on the branzino, our first choice entree (the kitchen ran out just before we had placed our order around 9:15pm). However, that being said, I left quite satisfied, and I'm willing to go back and give LV another shot -- next time, i won't skip dessert."
1,1,For the lack of better words. Shitty ramen. Overpriced. Would never come back. Totto ramen is way better. If I could give it no stars I would.
5,1,"I love Big Wong!!! Everything about this restaurant amazes me--the food, the staffs, the story and the crowd entrance... They not only have very tasty roast meat, but their congee, dim sums and other dishes are also pretty good. They keep the original flavor from Hong Kong. I was told by a Chinatown native that they have been at the same spot, operated by the same people, doing the same style of food for almost 30 years! Few of the restaurants in Chinatown actually has such a long history. They don't inflate nor deflate. The staffs are always fast and hospitable. It's always packed there, but I never wait more than 5 minutes for my takeouts. I am so amazed by their magic of keeping the good taste and service--being Big Wong!"
5,-1,"I still haven't managed to get here for the famous sandwiches, but the Lunch baked goods are good enough for me! Get several and bring them to co workers and never experience workplace tension again."
4,1,"While visiting Hilary G. (hilarybg.yelp.com), she and I met a mutual friend for lunch. ??I was coming in at Grand Central Terminal and so was our friend, so we decided to go nearby for lunch. ??We had considered eating at the Junior's in Grand Central Terminal, but it was crowded and the terminal is noisy and we wanted to take a walk, so we just wandered over to Broadway instead. Now, this was a Saturday around 1 PM in the theater district, so it was CROWDED. ??But we were not waiting longer than 20 minutes to sit down, and the service was still pretty attentive and fast. ??The waiter didn't speak English very well at all, but he got our lunch orders correct because he took the time to repeat everything and make sure he had it right. The major downfall of the service was that they were NOT good at busing dishes. ??There were three of us sitting at a small table for four, and we ended up having to stack our appetizer and dinner dishes so that we could have comfortable conversation and make room for the cheesecake we had ordered. ??It was irritating, but not a reason I'd refuse to go back, especially because I'd just as soon chalk it up to how busy the place was. The food was great. ??All three of us got reuben sandwiches and they were excellent. ??We got a side of fries for the table; it was disappointing that sandwiches didn't come with their own sides, but sharing was more cost-effective (financially and calorically), anyway. The cheesecake was excellent. ??HUGE slices, so an amazing value for the price. ??We got the chocolate marble cheesecake and the strawberry shortcake cheesecake. ??Awesome. ??Some of the best cheesecake I've ever had. ??And I've had a lot of freaking cheesecake (my dad was a baker). Go. ??The food is good, the services is fine, and the cheesecake lives up to the hype."
5,1,"Great experience at Barn Joo! I have been there twice already and its a great place to enjoy food and drinks with friends. My personal favorites were the wings, chick boki and the roasted mushrooms."

3,1,"there aren't enough handmade noodle shops in new york, so i was thrilled to be introduced to this hole-in-the-wall restaurant tonight! ??the noodles here are fantastic. ??broth is okay. ??dumplings are above average. ??would definitely make a trip out here again! i give it a 3.5!"
4,-1,"Very friendly, took a last-minute reservation. ??Everything was outstanding, especially the sliders and pork chop"
2,-1,"I wouldn't bother waiting outside for an hour for brunch - totally not worth it, it's all hype. Notice none of the locals do it. Go to the diner instead (Remedy diner on Houston and Norfolk) - no wait and great pancakes and burgers, much cheaper too :) Or 7A (7th street & Av A) or Frankies directly opposite Clinton St BC. If you really must go, do it during the day, early in the week when there's no lines. The food is fine but just not worth the wait. ooh, the diner does great malted chocolate milkshakes which you can't get at CSBC"
5,1,"New York! I had to scope out the best places right? Okay...so every establishment is like the size of a hallway, no difference here. There's like 5 items on the menu...or at least that's all I saw. I got the artichoke pizza of course and the sicilian. Artichoke was huuuuge....ok it's like $4 something I think but you get a good size. It was like eating warm artichoke soup on bread. Delish, especially on a cold day. Now to the real winner, the sicilian! YUM! The sauce is so good, then there's the cheesiness and all put together by the awesome buttery and crunchy bread. All good here, had to go twice it was so good. I hear it's usually crowded. We were lucky enough to only have a few people ahead of us the first time then the crowd started and the second time the place was all ours for the most part. I'd totez go again. Cash only. Some chick yelled like a maniac that they didn't accept credit cards....sorry princess?"
4,-1,"Breakfast at Tom's. What's not to like? Lots of choices, including the yummiest pancakes. It's the only place I know of in the NYC area that still can do cherry-lime rickeys AND wonderful egg creams. Plus, if you happen to come when they are busy and you have to wait in line, the staff comes around with coffee and cookies for free while you wait!"
2,1,"My friend hyped Spiegel and I was eager to go. On a recent Monday night it was not crowded, we snagged a great window table, and we were both very hungry. The waitstaff was prompt, attentive, and pleasant without being overbearing. The fish tacos caught my eye and the schnitzel sandwich was my partner's choice. Both entrees came promptly and were well presented. The fish tacos were a total disappointment. Both entrees were under-seasoned and in desperate need to salt. The fish in the tacos was fresh, well cooked, and the portion was ample. After the first taco, I lost interest. My dinner partner's schnitzel sandwich was a lot of bread! Again, the meat was in need of seasoning. Overall, a great space for a meal. I'm willing to believe I ordered wrong. Not sure I'll go back."
5,-1,"What a great choice! We ordered several dishes to share family-style, and it was such an enjoyable meal. Some of the dishes we ordered:chicken masala, saag paneer, vegetable samosas, and a curry dish, several types of naan, along with a few other dishes. Every dish was freshly prepared and delicious. The staff was attentive and efficient. Our bill was only just over $73.00 for 6 people. And then at the end of our meal, they brought us servings of mango ice cream and pistachio ice cream. It was enough for all of us to share, and both ice creams were smooth, fresh, and delightful. It was a great experience."
5,-1,"Despite the long waiting, I'm a regular here. The best time to go try their epic ramen is probably after 10pm on weekdays, so you only wait for 30 mins or so. The line's just consistent, never even thought about going there as a big group, although they have a very spacious eating area for a ramen place. I know it's crazy but it's that good. I would just wait & hang at the bar meantime, their ramen's worth the waiting."
4,-1,Ate here earlier this week. ??Excellent selection on the lunch special menu. ??I ordered the fish and chips that were very good. ??It was a large portion and very well priced. ?? I ordered a Palm beer draft and the selection of draft beers was excellent as well. ??Many micro brews were represented. ??Service was great and friendly ?? It is also a very comfortable restaurant. ??Highly recommended.
5,-1,"Honestly? couldn't get any better... its either the falafael or the shwarma both amazing. I have been in the middle east, and I tried some places in Brooklyn and the city itself (yes im a freak of shwarma). nothing can compare to this guys. Try the mint lemonade it comes naturally with the sandwich, its like ""they meant to be"". usually its a crowded place (and tiny as well) but they handle it very quickly and you never wait longer then 8-10 minutes to get it done. OH and pleaseee THE RED HOT SAUCE IS A MUST, but be careful its spicy - but its a big must. try to take few bites without any red sauce, and then add a little bit on the top so u can say the difference."
5,1,Don't even waste your time with the regular food. It sucks. These five stars are only for their cheesecakes!!!! if you love cheesecake and think that cheesecake factory is amazing.....Juniors will show you what amazing is!! I've never tasted anything as creamy as Junior's cheesecakes! YUM YUM YUM!!!!
5,1,Fat Buddha is a great spot for a quick get together or ending your night out... Bartenders are great and friendly you feel welcomed from the moment you sit at the bar or at a table by a waiter/ waitress... Dj plays a little bit of everything but needs to update to a little bit of spanish music... Location is great because it is so close to the L train on First Ave... one block down and around the corner and your golden. If you need to grab a cab at 4 am you can because it is a busy street and one block up is 14 street. Overall Great Time... Many other nights will be spent here with me and my friends
4,1,"As a CA transplant, I vouch for the carnitas burrito! Finally being trapped in Manhattan seems bearable."
5,-1,"Came in for the hot chicken, stayed for the lemonade. Came for a date night and discovered the wonders of hot chicken and boozy lemonade with blueberries! Left full, tipsy and loving life. Far better experience than at the Smoke Joint which I understand is connected."
5,-1,Ate @ Table 87 2nite with my brother and coal pizza was so good I had to get on yelp and let everyone kno this was one of the best pizza I have had in very long time. Large pie was huge and brought 2 slices home DEFINITLY will come back. Thanks to Table 87
5,-1,Excellent place to eat. My favorite dishes are the seafood papaya salad and green curry chicken and the watercress veggies. The soft shell crab was good but I don't really get that very often. Portions here are pretty big and you can choose your spicy level. The spicier the better though. Lines can get pretty long but if you have dinner a little earlier it's not too bad. It's also easier to get in if you go for a table for 2.
1,1,"*after writing this I noticed they announced that this was a soft opening 4 days ago...we were there a week ago. ??Maybe they realized they weren't ready to actually open. ??Still no excuse for the lack of hospitality. If I could give no stars I would. My friends and I went for brunch/lunch last weekend. ??The place is unorganized to say the least. ??The staff looked in shock/horror anytime people walked through the door...I mean you are open for business right??? ??We were there for at least 15 minutes before anyone took our order and we never received water or the coffee I ordered. ??I actually got up and asked for waters (after 30 minutes) from the counter and the girl (who kind of just hung out not helping anyone) gave them to me and didn't offer to carry them to the table. ??Apparently they are big on Southern Comfort food and not hospitality. ?? We ordered 3 sandwiches, 3 biscuits, a salad and mac and cheese (we were really hungry). ??We received 1 biscuit after 40 minutes, a salad after an hour, and then that's it. ??No really, that's it. ??After getting up to ask where the rest of our food was the waiter consulted the manager and then came over to us to tell us they ran out of the biscuits for our sandwiches (which btw only one of the sandwiches actually came on a biscuit). ??We were in shock. ??We had just wasted 1.5 hours of our Saturday for a biscuit and a salad. ??They offered to box up the remainder when it was ready if we needed to leave or asked if we wanted to cancel the rest. ??We canceled the rest, I mean how long would that take??? ??They did comp the salad and biscuit, which was a nice gesture but come on!!! ??No sincere apology, its like they just didn't care. I work in a restaurant as a server so I know openings can be rough but running out of food after only being open for less than 2 hours on a Saturday? ??Not serving water or setting the tables up with utensils??? ??The staff, who I'm sure are nice people, are terrible and should reconsider their current employment. ??We get it you look hip and cool but unfortunately that's not the business your in. I had big hopes for this neighborhood spot and hope that they survive long enough to get their act together so I can try the food. ??If they don't improve the service end they won't make it."
5,1,"You go to a steakhouse, you expect good steak. ??You go to a first place, you expect good fish. ??You go to purbird, and you'll get good chicken. ??That goes without saying, especially since it has a 5 star review. ??But, whats sets apart the good from the best is doing everything else well too; and it's with everything else that Purbird shines. Having eaten here more often that i care to admit, i've always found the chicken to be solid. ??Granted, I was a little surprised at the presentation of the half chicken order the first time i ordered it, but it's consistently good. ??And that, in and of itself is a rarity. ??Rarer still is the quality of the sides. The creamed spinach, the mac n' cheese, the mashed potatoes are all solid. ??Order any of those, and you'll likely not be disappointed by either the quality or the quantity for the price. ??But two things stand out as stellar items on their menu. ??The jalepeno mashed potatoes and the chicken pot pie. The jpm is an awesome mix of creamy spiciness. ??Not so spicy as to be overpowering, but just spicy enough for a little kick every now and then. The pot pie though is my hands down go to order. ??Baked in phyllo dough, though the appearance isn't what you may have in mind, the taste is spot on delicious and evokes some seriously good childhood memories with every bite."
5,1,This is the second times I went to this bar. The food was delicious. I had Korean sauce soba noodles ?? The prices was reasonable. Very crowded bc it is a small place in the basement but it's worth for the wait
4,1,"ASIAN FUSION in a nice atmosphere! wouldn't really consider Zutto to be a pub (but they do serve alcohol) definitely a gem in the rough (i didn't expect to find a restaurant like this in the area) where you could entertain w/ larger groups since they have a large table & even a sushi bar ----hikata SHORT RIB STEAMED BUNS: a MUST order appetizer!! (best short rib buns i've had to date) the crunch from the radish goes perfect w/ the buttery beef (comes w/ 2 large ones now instead of 3 small ones) ----original tonkatsu ramen: good, although the pork meat was a bit fatty (i like how they use thicker ramen noodles than ippudo) ----new parmesan ramen: interesting, but i think i'd stick to the japanese classics ----banana bread pudding: YUM, perfect carmelization on top w/ creme anglaise!! .....yeah we had a feast LOL foursquare check-in got us a FREE asahi beer"
3,1,"We were excited to dine here especially after we found out it was featured on ""unique eats."" We left disappointed. The food was good but it's not worth the hype IMO. The beer steamed mussels were very good. You can taste the garlic and the olives in the sauce. The hot sauce gave it a nice kick. I even used the mussel shells to scoop up the sauce. The bread that was on top however, is every dentists' nightmare. Super hard. Watch out esp if you have anterior crowns. The chicken waffle is not worth the hype at all. I like the batter used but I was really expecting something... Unique. We actually wanted to grab Popeyes later if anything. Both chicken are good but for the price I can get a family meal ( complete different experience, I understand) The hubs got the duck meat loaf. He enjoyed it and it's true.. It's unique. good food, fast service and friendly waitstaff but IMO, it's really nothing special. Sorry"
2,-1,"I've always loved this place for their fantastic (and fast) to-go vegetarian sandwiches and delicious sweet potato fries. HOWEVER, the first time I sat down to eat here, the waitress was rude and curt, and when we left her our payment with exactly 15% tip, SHE ACTUALLY STOPPED US FROM LEAVING AND TOLD US WE HADN'T GIVEN ENOUGH TIP. This is so incredibly unprofessional. I will not be coming back or recommending this place to anyone. Plus, their only vegetarian pho option is very bland."
5,-1,"Great, laidback place to grab a beer and some grub. Don't let the fact that it's a bar fool you--the food here is a must! I've had the burger, pork sandwich and grilled cheese and everything's been super fresh and totally beyond what I expected (even the pickles on the burger are crazy good). And they come with a mountain of fries which are totally TO DIE FOR! On top of that, there's a great selection of brews (which changes a lot so don't get too tied to a fav.) to wash it all down."
4,-1,"The title says it all - this place is perfectly located for a brunch during shopping in Soho. The food is good, the service is attentive and at day time there shouldn't be an issue with reservations."

5,1,"Me and my partner were looking for a nice place to make our wedding reception party. As soon as we got there we met the manager Giuseppe , he offered us few options of brunch with unlimited drinks. The brunch was phenomenal , the prentation was amazing and the food was delicious and fresh... like no other Italian places I've dined. The service was great and every few min there was someone that came to the table to ask if we need anything. The food that was served was in a tapas style and we got more than we paid for. The place itself ??was very clean and tastefully decorated.....nice lighting, amazing for pics. The sad part was that the two and half hours went so fast and I had to call it a day."
1,-1,"Despite our reservation on a ??winter's night, we were seated right next to the door and were very cold. ??When we asked if we could sit further away from the door we were told that we could not ??because they were holding a table for a large party. ??Repeated requests to turn the heat up were met with the response that the people in the back would get too hot. As we were drinking our coffee we were told that we would have to leave because there were people waiting for our table. We had been at the table for about an hour. ??The food was fine, but we were treated rudely and the atmosphere was unwelcoming."

3,-1,"We were so looking forward to L'Artusi opening. We love Dell'Anima and go often to this wonderful Italian gem. After last night's experience it looks like we will continue going to Dell'Anima. L'Artusi is a beautiful restaurant, lively, noisy and visually stimulating with its different stations and counters. The food is good and the service is friendly but good. Yet it does not have the authentic feel of its sister restaurant nor the same quality of the food. The portions are small and from the people around us lots of sharing was going on. Seemed like more of a social event with the food coming in second. Perhaps since its new it will develop its character with time."
5,-1,"Omg!!!! This place was EXCELLENT!! The boyfriend and I are from CA and we stopped by here last night. We ordered the ??General Tao, the bada bing and the truffle fries...all I can say WOW! Everything was delicious. My favorite, the bada bing. It is like a chicken Parmesan. Paul (awesome guy) gave us a sample of the salted caramel pretzel, amazing. My boyfriend fell in love with the general Tao..Soo yummy! if you like chicken, this is a must go to. The guys here are great! We had an awesome experience and the product was to die for! Very friendly, clean and great food! Wish they opened one in CA we would be there everyday!"
2,-1,"What a disappointment. ??I finally visited and am very sorry to report that this place was underwhelming. ??I like the small, mom-and-pop atmosphere and understand that with that comes slower service at times. ??I can deal with that. ??I cannot deal with not being told what the special is (especially at a place like this), having unfilled water glasses, not taking our order for about 20 minutes, generally being ignored and salmon that was so severely overcooked that it was totally dried out. ??Quite frankly, my issues with the service could have been rectified by a simple acknowledgement and apology. ??I think perhaps a visit on a less busy night might result in a better experience but all in all I'm so sad to say I didn't like this place."
5,1,"You would never think that this tiny place produced such big bold flavors. I've known this place for a while and came a number of times. The traditional viet sandwich here (i like mine spicy) is so damn good. It doesnt matter if i came with a mind set of only getting noodles or rice, i always end up ordering a sandwich on top of whatever i ordered. Last time my bf and i came her we had a viet coffee ??(very strong, good for coffee lovers), milk tea, he had his big noodle soup (always forget the proper name), i had the grilled pork chop w/egg and i added chinese sausage (like a sam bo fan). Of course the add on is additional but wow it is worth it. The pork chops here is incredible. Juicy, fatty, so much flavor! With our entrees, we shared a sandwich. On our way out, we ordered two more sandwiches to go!"
5,-1,"The very first restaurant my husband took me to when we moved to nyc in 2009, love it as much now as I did then. Food is amazing, service is wonderful. Ambiance is very sexy and ""NYC"". Truly one of my absolute favorites. Service is great and they have a sense of humor. i've spent a lot of wonderful, special nights with good friends here over the years. Truly a special place with excellent food, wine and cocktails!"
4,1,overpriced but pretty chill. good mixed drinks and nice beer selection. dimmed lights give a good atmosphere
4,1,"First the service: after reading other reviews about the service at Casa Mono I was a little nervous about going, but we were ??was happily surprised. Our waiter was polite and helpful and there was no evidence that he was trying to rush us out. It is definitely a tight space with very loud music. Since it was just my husband & myself that was fine, but I don't think I would go in a larger group. Next the food: it was delicious! We had 5 tapas...I have never tasted such good parsnips in my life! ??We also tried the octopus, sardines and venison. To be adventurous, our last choice were the cocks combs. I can't say I disliked them, but once is enough. They are the texture of mushy liver and they tasted just like the mushrooms they were cooked in. ??Finally the desert, definitely leave some room for it. We had the chocolate cake and custard. Both were amazing and a great deal!"
5,-1,"We go crazy for Bonnie's Grill ! Each time we are thinking burger, wherever on the globe we are, we think of their delicious food! Not only it is tasty, spicy (as you like) and on the bill of fair but, AND also the owner himself is at the charbroiled grill for you! He looks for excellence in your food and it comes straight on your palate ! Very relaxed and classic rock-and-roll, Bonnie's Grill is on our worldwide Top List !!!"
5,-1,"Upon moving to the upper west side I was on a hunt for the best bar and restaurant in the area. This is it! If you're looking for great food, look no further. Everything I've tried has been made with the utmost care for flavor and the portions are huge! Their biscuit sandwiches are light and fluffy and their pancakes with fried chicken and bacon are the best pancakes I've been able to find in NYC. They've even made grits a must-order item on their menu. And of course, their pickles are crispy and flavored to perfection. Their service has always been great and I have no complaints. As for the bar, if there's an open chair, grab it! The bartenders are friendly and make a damn good Manhattan. Their selection of craft beer is one of the better selections I've come across at a very reasonable price. The lines can be long depending on what time you drop by, but it is well worth the wait. If you're looking to sample their food and beverage selection without too much of a wait, just head in for an early dinner and if you want to stay for the night, head on over to the bar. This is always the first place I recommend when people ask me for a restaurant or bar suggestion!"
1,-1,"Not worth the trip. ??Have been excited about going to this place for some time. ??We could only get a late reservation, but figured if we sat down at 10:00 (the time of the reservation) that would be fine. ??We had heard great things and really were hoping to not be disappointed. We literally waited 35 minutes to be seated, during which we received perhaps one comment from a hostess that they were sorry we were waiting. ??As the 30 minute mark approached, they starting promising to ""take care of us"" over and over and over again, so we didn't really complain and just dealt with the absurdly long wait. The food was good - not the best we've had - but some things really did stand out (the squash toast was superb). ??Others, like the cod, were absolutely drenched in oil/grease and simply did not taste good. ?? When the bill came, we were surprised to see that the only way they ""took care of us"" was bringing us a cheap appetizer for free. ??Normally I would be fine with that, but when you're not seated until 10:45 and it's already that late and you're promised to be taken care of by 4 different people, it's almost a slap in the face that our drinks or dessert or something else wasn't done to make us feel better about what shaped up to be a less-than-memorable experience. In the past, when this has happened at other restaurants, we've had managers come over and profusely apologize and comp our entire meals, or our drinks, or bring us multiple dishes as a means of apologizing for a mistake they made. ??When you have hostesses constantly stating they'll take care of you and then the waiter reiterating this, we were frankly appalled by ABC's lack of client service. ??You simple won't make it in this city if you can't treat your clientele with the respect they deserve. I don't care how good or new a restaurant you are - if you can't seat your customers within a reasonable time of arriving, you're failing. ??And if that does happen, you need to make much more of an effort to appease those who clearly are frustrated - especially when it's that late in the evening and they've been waiting to eat for so long. ??It really is a shame."
4,1,"I finally hit up this place a couple of weeks ago, and being someone whose mother can fry chicken better than most any place you will buy it, I was prepared for disappointment. ??But, to my surprise, the chicken was kickin'! ??The crust was flavorful and seasoned just enough. ??The off-the-bone piece of breast meat, which resembled Meat Wad but in chicken form, was amazing. ??Chicken breast is tough to fry to perfection, where the meat is actually still juicy and not dry, but they got it right over there. ??there was also a delectable wing and a thigh (naturally) in the chicken box order. They ain't scurred of shortening and/or butter in the biscuits either. ??These dense masterpieces are a cross between flaky style biscuits and buttermilk style biscuits. ??Honestly, I could have had that and the chicken breast plus my side and been a happy camper. My mac and cheese was scrumptious. ??Next time I will opt to go without the squirt of Buffalo wing sauce on it. ??Personally, that doesn't do it for me on mac and cheese. ??But it was well-made and reeked of comfort food. For dessert, I had a banana pudding pie deal that I had a conniption over. ??My Southern roots make me an automatic expert of banana pudding (well, really, all of this stuff), and they nail it. ??I can't wait for another cheat meal day so I can go back. The price seems high for fried chicken, but I am growing used to this in NYC. ??Still, it won't keep me away. ??Like Arnold said: ""I'll be back!"""
5,1,"This is the most adorable, cozy little place and I'm so glad we decided to go here. The decor is kind of rustic, shabby, eclectic but mainly just really warm and inviting. ??I love it. The staff is really friendly, gave us a reservation and was really nice when I called to say we were running late. ?? As far as food goes, I can only speak for the nachos. ??Between the four of us, we shared the chicken nachos which were really good. ??The chips were homemade and had black beans, cheese, chicken, guac, sour cream, jalapenos... maybe some other things. ??Not too sure because I had a few Long Islands by the time we got the food. The drinks were well prepared and tasted great. ??They came with these colorful and cute little plastic figures ??of mermaids, camels, monkeys, etc... Some of the specialty drinks were served in Mason jars which I love. ??The specialty drinks were kind of expensive ($10-$11) but I guess that's actually pretty good by NYC standards and I don't recall the pricing for beer. ?? Overall we had a really good time at this place and would recommend it for people who want a cozy place to catch up with friends and have a few cocktails."
3,1,"There's really nothing too special about the food here. We ordered spaghetti and meatballs... I definitely didn't feel like it was the best I've ever had, by any means. One entr??e was way more than enough for two people... it could have fed 4 ladies easily. At least the service wasn't compromised by the crowd. Our waitress was very friendly, outgoing, and funny -- she made us feel right at home :) Another server, even brought us free dessert (""prettiest girls he'd seen all night"")..... so the service was great, but the food wasn't."
5,-1,"Incredible place definitely go here and if the weather is nice, request to sit in the garden it is so pleasant! The food is great and will actually come very spicy if you want it that way.

4,1,"Celebrated my pre-birthday with 11 of my friends tonight and I love that our table was ready when we arrived. Our server brought out two baskets filled with tiny breads with a bean dip...I believe. As my remainder guests arrived, we all check-in into Foursquare or Yelp for a free glass of Sangria. Me and some other people got the Fresas and one of my friends didn't like the Tropical Sangria...it didn't taste like a good white wine to match the slices of pineapples. I tried some of my friends' Calamari Frito...it was pretty yummy! I ordered a Bistec (well done) very delicious. We got free sweet and fried plantains on the house. ??I don't remember what everyone else got but they did really enjoy their dishes. Me and two of my friends took home our leftovers. I think the service was good but I wasn't really paying attention to be honest. Dinner lasted for three hours and it was an amazing, unforgettable night! Definitely must come back for Brunch with the unlimited Sangria."

5,-1,"Best pizza I've ever had. My daughter and I were visiting New York and tried this place on recommendations from locals. ??We had the margherita pizza and it was spectacular and it was served to us by the owner. We have never tried Grimaldi's, so we can't compare (and we aren't too familiar with the pizza wars and lawsuits), but I can highly recommend Juliana's."
5,-1,"The BEST PIZZA in New York, i love the artichoke pizza its a slice of heaven!!!"
2,1,"What is all the fuss about?? Perhaps the positive reviews can be partly attributed to diners who are accustomed to 39?? instant ramen from a cellophane package. But how to explain the reactions of professional restaurant critics? I've eaten ramen in many cities, incl Tokyo, and Ippudo fails to register on all criteria. The chicken-based broth tastes like Campbell's chicken soup. The pork-based broth is flavorful but nothing special. Both have too much garlic (not a standard flavor in most ramen). Moreover, ramen should be served steaming hot...literally: steam should be rising from the bowl. Theirs was on the far side of warm but certainly not very hot. And at the risk of pulling a Woody Allen (""This food is bad...and the portions are so small""), the portions are hardly generous. Yes, one can order an extra ball of noodles for $2, but as the menu explains, this requires that enough broth remain from the primary dish to accommodate the extra noodles. Hard to imagine how this could be possible. Perhaps this really is the best ramen NYC has to offer. If so, it's better than nothing. But certainly don't waste 2 hrs of your life waiting for it."
5,1,"Awesome food, impeccable service and of course very expensive!"
2,1,"Don't believe the hype. Disappointing Three of us arrived 15 mins early to have an apero at the bar while waiting for the fourth to arrive but the entire place was so packed with people and noisy we just wanted to go straight to our table. We were told that we could not be seated at until the 4th guest arrived (by this stage we were less than 10 minutes before our reservation time). They were trying to turn over tables quicker than a Tex-Mex on a Friday night. We were obliged to go back out into the freezing, blustery night and into to their sister restaurant next door for our apero which was finally quite pleasant. We went back in happily to find our table was ready and once a little away from the bar the noise level became just reasonable. Our well informed charming waitress advised us on our wine and though I chose something half the price (Rosso di Altesino 2010) it was a very good wine. The food however was mostly disappointing. The beet salad was an uninspiring few slices of beetroot; the frito misto (mostly fritto) was only equal to any to be found at any random take out and had the tinniest rings of calamari I'd seen for a while; and three ordinary meatballs for $14? They could have at least added a 4th. The pasta that was described as having duck sausage was a bland, salty, mushy lump of over cooked pasta and broccoli with barely a hint of duck sausage. The Paccheri pasta with cinghiale (wild boar) was much better but still nothing special while the Pappardelle with lamb bolognese was pretty good. We shared a lemon tart and a chocolate cake that were both tasty but nothing out of the ordinary. All in all disappointing though at $70 per head we got out of there reasonably light."
3,-1,Good food and great service! Staff is really nice! Little pricey.
4,-1,Not much to say besides its GREAT! Well worth the wait......My tip is to call ahead and just walk in and pick up the pie. Staff is very nice and pie is ALWAYS as good as the last!!
4,-1,"Had a brunch of tomato salad and fried eggs here. Food was good, ingredients were fresh. Friendly service."
4,-1,"i LOVE this place. You always see Korean girls on the street nearby with their map and you just know they're looking for Ippudo. Great ramen. Perfect consistency and spicy without overpowering the other ingredients. Excellent service, though staff seem a little rushed or overwhelmed at times with the long lines. Definitely worth the wait."
5,1,"Seriously, amazing falafels for the cheap. You get MORE than you pay for. Yum! My sister brought me one of their falafels all the way to Florida. It was soggy, but still amazing."
2,1,"Only for roast duck, not thing special ,"
5,1,"LOVE, love, love this place! I've been to many ramen places but none of them really left a lasting impression as Ippudo has. it is by far, the BEST yet! I'm not one who usually like to drink soups/broths, but the broth they use in their Akamaru Modern here is so good that I will drink it all up by itself! The pork belly is just orgasmic to your tastebuds and melts in your mouth! The best time to go is right when they open up for the dinner rush at about 6pm...anytime after that, then expect a very LONG wait! I've been here once where there was a 3...yes, THREE hour wait for a table! Crazy, i know...and the prices are pretty expensive don't get me wrong (afterall, this is just ramen right? )...ahh, but it is NOT JUST ramen! it's an ADDICTION!!!...and it's well worth it!"
2,-1,It would an awesome place if the staff was a little bit nicer.
5,-1,"Always is a pleasure to eat on this place ! Great food , nice service, even you can flirt around lol"
5,1,I love this restaurant!!! The menu is ever seasonally changing and the food is devourable!!! My advice: go with either lots of room in your tummy or a group of four people who are not picky to share dishes and eat your way through the menu!!
5,1,"Excellent friendly service!! Looooved the ""meat candy"" sandwich."
5,1,"I can't say anything that hasn't already been said - The waits are long but I've never had a bad dish here, and there's a bar around the corner to get a beer while you wait. The pork buns are amazing, and in a different league than Momofuku's. The shisito peppers are tasty. The ramens are heavenly. ??All of them. ??With seasoned eggs and spicy paste and ... just heavenly. ?? Fun atmosphere."
5,-1,"You won't find a better - or cheaper - brunch in Brooklyn. Lunch and dinner are fantastic, too, and the service is always friendly and efficient."
5,1,"Best banh mi in NYC. The Buddha's Delight is an amazing vegetarian banh mi with a few different mushrooms, tofu, baby corn, veggies, and all kinds of other goodness in it. It costs 75 cents more than the meat options. I'm not sure what that says about the meat, but the pork chop sandwich *tastes* great."
4,1,"Modern is good. ??Pork buns are better. ??If you go when it opens, you rarely have to wait. ??Between me and you, I prefer the noodles at Toto."
5,1,Loved the place and the Food. My pasta was finger licking good. One of my best food places in the city
4,1,It loses a star for service and space. To be fair it was a rainy day - but there was no space to wait for our table and it took a very long time to get a drink after we sat down. But everything got better once we got that drink and it ended up being a great dining experience. The food is BOMB. The hot fried chicken is really delicious. Sides are tight. I would highly recommend going here - just don't go with a big group. 4 person party max.
5,1,"This place wasnt bad. I got combo A, crawfish and shrimp with the boil special and fire sauce. I regret the fire now, but still good. The real reason I gave it 5 stars is because of the music. Please continue playing those old school tracks"
2,1,"kind of disappointed about Jane. we were having brunch today and made a reservation while the restaurant still partially empty. Since we had to wait for two more friends to come and they won't let us seat yet. well....I do understand that. BUT once my friends came and i still need to wait for another half hours due to I had a party of 5. They won't seat us to any smaller or bigger table and the whole restaurant only have one table to sit us in. They used some many excuses to explain and push me to wait again. The food is an average. It wasn't worth the wait time in a crowded + noise restaurant. we order salmon Benedict, mushroom omelet and french toast. the salmon Benedict was delicious but the others was just so so. the home fries was overcook and hard and same as french fries as well. I definitely won't go back again."
3,1,"It's no difference than Empire Building or Statute of Liberty, very international; It's a tourist's destination; it's like you will definitely try Peking Roasted Duck at QuanJuDe when you travel to BeiJing. It maybe a dream for people never live in New York before. However, it should be not that much special for locals. I am a non-New Yorker. Landed here last September. First time to give a shot without any plan or reservation. After my yoga class I passed by and suddenly was attracted by the busy scene. I like the feeling I had at that moment. You saw people talking and laughing loudly. A very energized Saturday Morning. I was recommended to try the Scrambled Egg in Puff Pastry. The pastry is crispy and tastes a lot butter. The scrambled eggs are scrambled eggs, not outstanding. Asparagus and Mushrooms are fresh enough. I will called it a One Morning Stand."
5,1,"This is the Best Shabu Shabu in NYC! ??Always fresh vegetables and high quality meat. The place is a bit small but it's not necessarily a bad thing. ??Great selection on the menu, great service, and intimate atmosphere. ??They also have some decent happy hour specials. ??You can only make a reservation with a party of 6 or more and cause there seems to always be a long line for dinner. ?? Best advice- get there for an early dinner, otherwise you'll have to patiently wait like everyone else (but def worth it). ??At least they have bench outside...or just wander about the East Village..."
5,-1,"Had lunch with friends. What a delightful meal. I will definately go back. The atmosphere was relaxing, food tasty and good portions. I recommend you trying it out!"
3,-1,"So I thought I try this place since I'm a big fan of ramen and this is supposed to be the best ramen/noodle place in town though I did have my doubts. ??While it's ok, I would not say it's the best. ??I actually like the noodle texture at Momofuku better. ??The noodles are basically under-cooked and too hard for my taste. ??As with Momofuku, the broth is way too salty. ??Again, it really depends on your taste buds. ??But given the insane wait especially during the weekends (sometimes 2 hours or more), I cannot recommend this place. ??There are similar if not better noodle places on St Mark's Pl in the East Village without the ridiculous wait time."
5,1,"Quaint place in the Slope! The boyfriend and I stopped by here about a month ago, celebrating our anniversary. We were attracted to the flower decorations and how the outside area looked, keep in mind this was back in August. It's great for summer evenings and days, I am sure. The food was moderately priced for the great quality that was served. Entrees from 18 to 28, not bad. I believe they have their vegetables according to season and their menu surely changes a few times a year, depending on what is in harvest and what not. We shared fried goat cheese to start out with. The bf got the roasted chicken, he highly recommends this. I went on with a veggie entr??e. The food was tasty, well seasoned, and you felt like the cook had still put some heart into the matter instead of mass producing it. We found it was a good night to go with the Ros??, and voila, it was an excellent choice! The service was great. I will gladly try out their brunch on occasion!"
1,1,I was quite interested by this bar after reading the reviews. Never have I been more disappointed. I clearly have a different idea of what constitutes a nice place for conversation with atmosphere. To begin with head banging music played at ear shattering levels is hardly conducive to conversation. The bartender was only interested in mumbling along to the songs and seemed oblivious to the concept of customers. The crowd in the front room was almost exclusively people way under the legal age who enjoy screaming over the music and at each other. And yes... The back is quieter if you are prepared to sit on a couch watching couples make out to the point where you want to offer to buy them the room. Neighborhood bar? Quaint and atmospheric? NOT worst bar I have been to in recent memory. Reviews are misleading. Kimberly
3,1,"Big portions, ok food. ??I didn't get to try the cheesecake because my dinner date didn't want to split a piece and I'm not such a cheesecake fan that I would eat it myself. ??I took dinner's leftovers out in a doggie bag. ??Unlucky for me, you can't bring food into the theater to watch a show so I had to throw it away. ??This place isn't so good that I would come back again."
5,-1,Long wait but definitely worth the wait for Ramen and Buns!!!
5,-1,The food is consistently delicious and never disappointing. A bit touristy on the weekends and extremely hard to get in to... Eggs Florentine are delicious ! Steak frites!!! One of the bst i've ever had
2,1,"Went here for brunch. They were out of almost every signature dish on the menu. The service was pretty shoddy. Each dish (4 top) was well made, however none of us were too blown away. The atmosphere is really cute and I bet much better at night"
5,-1,I am a registered dietitian and an aerobics instructor and absolutely love the selection They have! Bobs plate is my favorite! I definitely recommend anything on the menu to everyone in the area! It's definitely worth the visit
2,-1,"I had lunch here and I must say the food is good! Next time I will take it to go because the service is the worst!! I don't want to come in and be treated like I owe you for dinning at your establishment , no way!! ??The food was good but I don't want to get aggravated when I eat , no worth it!! The only reason I'm writing this review is because the excellent service I just received at Brooklyn dinner . Night and Day !!"
2,1,"Dear Jane, You used to be one of our favorite restaurants. We loved the warm vibe--long bar, lots of wood, a cool quiet back room, kid-friendly. And the food was reliably good. But tonight was a real let-down. Prices are up. ($18 for a burger?) Food took a real long time coming. And it was crummy: Burgers (we ordered 3) were overcooked and greasy. Mussels were cold and fishy. Root vegetables were weird (was that curry? some other strange overlay?) We'd love to come back. But at these prices, the food would need to be a heck of a lot better."
4,-1,"Wonderful atmosphere (check out the Japanese bathrooms) and great for dinner. But definitely give their (completely different from dinner) lunch menu a pass. It's overpriced and doesn't have that great of options. There is the same or better in the neighborhood, like East or Sushi Time, for less."
5,-1,Great place to come and eat with the family. A little on the pricey side but certainly worth it. Keep up the good work!
3,1,After all the hype from our friends --Roberta's pizza didn't do it for us?!! Highlight was my root beer :D Disappointment bitter beer :( Ordered: Bibb lettuce -cherry vinaigrette with roasted walnuts and Gorgonzola. Pleasingly good which I've recreated this at home many times. ?? As for the pizza... artisanal offerings but didn't highten.... crust flavor that wasn't memorable... Perhaps the wood-burning oven wasn't HOT yet. ??Such a shame because we enjoy venturing out to new places. We prefer Fornino.
5,-1,"Super fresh sea food any fresher and id have to fish it out of the sea myself. And the service is beyond words, i love the atmosphere there it is truly an amazing place best Korean food around I recommend it to everyone."
4,-1,Their sliders are perfect. I've had the bacon ones too and they are delicious. The chipotle ketchup is top notch too.
4,1,"I loved the chicken edamame salad and nice piece of soft roll brown bread that came with it. ??I was curious about the warm paninis and pita sandwhiches, but wanted some greens! The best part about this place was the food tasted very fresh and 'farm to table'. ??even the atmosphere was calming and relaxing, as long as the peeps that walked through the door weren't using their outdoor voices inside :) I'm happy to have found such a healthy feeling lunch spot, look out subway, there's a new lunch spot in town!"
4,-1,"I love this place. Their lunch specials can be as cheap as $6.90 - and for a huge plate of delicious green curry, plus spring rolls, I'm a happy camper! Delicious and fairly inexpensive."
4,1,"You can never go wrong with a chicken over rice plate, white and hot sauce. It's my go to order, I can't say much for the kabob but the service is friendly and fast. My father still regrets not being able to sample this tasty treat when he was in town."
4,-1,"Joys is definitely one of my go to Thai restaurants! ??Every time I visit the food is just as I remembered. ??The mango salad has become one of my all time favorite dishes. Sometimes the wait staff can be a bit inattentive, but I think that's just because they are so busy."
4,-1,"wonderful Italian spot. great patio so it's worth waiting for a nice night. all around delicious (i suggest the meatballs and the sweet potato and sage ravioli) and great atmosphere (exposed brick, candles). quite reasonable which is also a nice plus. cash only."
4,1,"Went for lunch and had the prix fixe. It was nothing short of absolutely astounding. The environment was very comfortable without being too stuffy. Each course was very well designed and packed several complimentary flavors. At $55 for the prix fixe, it is probably the most value I've ever gotten from a nice restaurant. Definitely recommended!"
4,1,"just picked up regular wonton nooddle soup ($4.50) for lunch. If you do pick up, it will take you only 2 minutes for waiting time. It is tasty and the soup base is good. They put extra scallion. yumm..I will def. go back to this place!"
4,-1,Taco Taco Taco I loves Tacos. Come here you will never be let down. Green sauce on my tounge tacos. Yes
3,-1,"This place is great, but I recommend skipping the insane brunch lines and getting those blueberry pancakes at dinner. They serve them at night as well, and it's never been hard to get a table ??for dinner. Unfortunately, the french toast isn't on the dinner menu, though. The fried chicken here is perfect, and they also give you a little basket of mini biscuits before your meal at dinner. They also have a little bakery section here where you can get things like scones, muffins, biscuits and coffee to go."
4,1,"If you can't get to Brooklyn to visit the original, this will do nicely. Also as before/after theater eats! Great sandwiches. A nice matzoh ball soup, and of course, great cheesecake."
4,1,"So I was craving Thai food one lazy Saturday and didn't have anything else to do, so I decided to take a trip to Sripraphai in Queens, which I had heard was the best and most authentic in the city. For some reason (I think it's the weather), I've been pretty obsessed with Thai food lately, and I haven't been afraid of spicy food either. I started off with a Thai Iced Tea, which was really really sweet. I ordered it without milk, as I am wont to do, so I can balance the sweetness with some lime. Very tasty. I also ordered the crispy (fried) watercress salad, with shrimp, squid and chicken. This was awesome, even though the seafood and chicken were buried under a mountain of fried watercress, which was very crispy indeed. The lime juice, garlic, red onion, and chilies seasoned the salad perfectly, and when I ate the leftovers for dinner that night (portions are big), the flavors melded together even more and tempered the crispiness of the watercress. A truly excellent salad that I've been thinking about ever since. I ordered the drunken noodles as my main course, which were recommended to me by someone on some message board somewhere. They were good, but not spectacular. I kind of wish I had gotten something else, like a curry or something, as I had had similar noodles in a (very decent) thai place in manhattan previously. A nice touch is that they served chopped green chillies in some sauce or oil on the side, which i put on my noodles. I thought the noodles were very good, but I don't think I would come out all the way to queens for them. I asked for my food medium spicy, because I had heard that this place is serious with heat. Maybe it's because I'm a white guy and they toned it down, but I wish it were spicier. Next time I'll just destroy myself and ask for it spicy. The picture menu was great, and very useful. Prices were reasonable too. Almost everything was under $10. Bottom line: great thai food at great prices. Definitely worth the trip. Can't wait to go back!"
5,-1,"Although it's been open a couple of years, I just recently went there for lunch during Restaurant Week. ??It was wonderful! ??Besides the utterly delicious food, the room is lovely, it's beautifully situated, and the service was excellent. ??We were so delighted with our experience, that we went for brunch, and are going again for dinner."
4,1,"great neighborhood bar which is convenient since it happens to be in my neighborhood. ??the bartender was friendly. jukebox and various games (skeeball, jenga etc) are cool. nice little ""backyard"" to chill in. ??cheap drinks."
3,1,"Boom! Real Chinese food. The animals hanging in the window are not just for decoration, they are for eating. Two kinds of fresh Pork the crispy back and boneless spare ribs, both so damn good, also sold in bulk to go. The duck is delicious. Very authentic Chinese food the most authentic I have found since my travels to China. Plus it is open till 4am on weekends. How can you go wrong?"
4,-1,I love asian food. The chicken sandwich which are proposed in this reestaurant is exactly that I like and that I want. Very good
4,-1,"I loved this place, very clean tables, nice staff and the pork belly buns are fantastic! I went there for a lunch and could not have been happier. I love the pork belly buns but if you like duck, be advantageous and try the All Duck Lunch. Overall a very nice place with delicious Korean food."
1,-1,"Decent french food but not worth returning unless it is empty and there is no wait. They don't employ a maitre d' and the ""i am trying really hard"" to be super french staffer doesn't keep a waiting list. Typical of many pompous waiters and restaurants that think they can remember everything without writing it down---makes them even more special i guess. Anyway, the place was packed, they made no efforts at controlling the crowd flowing thru the door and despite acknowledging us several times when we identified some jerk trying to cut the line, the lame staffer still sat them ahead of us and all he could say was oops sorry-made a mistake. Having waited for more than 45 minutes and then that happens was disappointing. We told the owner and she was adamant that he kept a waiting list. Don't think she will be in business long. The food is just not that exponentially better than places that have more professional staff. If it is busy, be prepared to police the line yourself so mr frenchy doesn't let his pals sit first---although this time i think he was just slipped some cash!!!"
4,1,Casual neighborhood place with reasonable prices and good food. I had the salmon and it is the tastiest piece of fish I've had in a while.Crispy seasoned crust. I requested it to be cooked medium rare and that was exactly what I got. The fish was so tender and the contrast of the crispy skin was just wonderful.The string beans that were served on the side was equally cooked well. Nice and green and still had a good texture. My only complaint is that there was a lot of melted butter on the bottom of the dish. The service was great. The waiter came to refill our wine regularly. We were not rushed at all. I will be back!
4,1,"Piora is not the type of place I typically find myself in. I first visited this restaurant only several weeks after opening, when they started offering a cuisine best described as New American, with Italian and Korean influences. Despite my best attempts, I found myself scanning through their menu multiple times prior to our reservation and after a glowing review from Jess C., finally gave in and made my way over after work on a Thursday evening. The entrance to Piora is difficult to pinpoint as there's no evident signage, but after realizing what the logo, a P and R reflected off each other, stood for, I immediately stepped inside and made my way over to the bar. When the rest of our party arrived, our hostess seated us in the slightly separated area between the bar and the main dining room, which had a perfect view of the entire restaurant. While it's by no means large, the team has done amazing things with the space that they have. The window that spans across the entire back of the room lets in a fair amount of sunlight in the early evening and offers a view bordered with plenty of foliage, a rarity in downtown Manhattan. Lining the walls of Piora is a simple, modern weave of lines that only accentuates the elegance and simplicity of the dining room. Owner Steve Kim greeted us personally and as the venue had yet to fill up, invited us to walk around as he delineated the meaning behind the restaurant's name, which is Korean for ""blossom"". As for the menu, Piora's offerings are fairly compact, covering the basic appetizer, pasta, entrees, and sides. Compact doesn't mean that it's any less difficult to make a final decision, and I wavered a great deal between the proteins and pastas, as each dish sounds just as delicious as the others. We tried our best to get a good variety of dishes and opted to start the meal off with a tray of Monkey Bread. It's served piping hot out of oven in an iron tray, given a light sprinkling of sea salt on top, and paired with a seaweed butter and whipped lardo. The bread is flaky and buttery and a solid introduction for the courses that would follow. I had opted for the Scallops with Sweet Corn, Chanterelles, and Crispy Chicken Skin and it wound up being my favorite dish of the night. The two scallops, the star of the dish, were seared perfectly and smartly paired with the creamy corn-based sauce that accompanied the plate. These kernels of corn were some of the sweetest I have yet to taste, the chanterelle mushrooms contributed just a hint of earthiness to the dish, and the addition of the chicken skin was a delightful surprise, adding both texture and richness to round out each bite. The Agnolotti followed, and while I was slightly disappointed with the rather small portion size, I soon learned not to make judgments based only on appearances. The agnolotti were neatly folded and each contained a delicious filling of pecorino cheese, and with the addition of aromatic preserved truffles and English peas, it made for a fairly satisfying main course. The flavors are perfectly balanced, allowing you to taste and appreciate each of the ingredients and elements of the dish. My only criticism of this dish is that the chef was perhaps a little too heavy-handed with the salt, as I had to reach for my glass of water several times between bites. Piora isn't perfect. As with any new restaurant, it's still in the process of settling in and figuring out a rhythm of its own. It's evident in the slight awkwardness as a server tries to find space to place down a new dish, in the lapse of time between courses. What it lacks in familiarity, however, Piora makes up for with the genuine welcome given to each guest, in the enthusiasm of the servers as they go through the menu options, and the artistry that's presented on each plate. I would love to return and give my palate a chance to explore the rest of their creations; from what I've experienced so far, Piora has truly blossomed. -- [1] Congrats to Piora for securing one star in the 2015 Michelin List!"

Was pretty average ramen. ??I had the spicey totto ramen or whatever and the soup was very light and bland. ??I suppose if your into that kind of thing you could check it out. To me however, the wait of upwards 1.5 hrs is not worth it. ??The guy never filled my water after the initial cup on the table, was thoroughly let down.

3,1,"bar old fashioned (unknown bourbon) was solid, made properly. table bread reminiscent of garlic bread. fish and chips batter on fish was light. taste was light too. chips were okay, soft. good tartar sauce. fried quail small portion of quail, good. large portion of collard greens, delicious. spoon bread, okay. tragedy khadafi."
5,1,"Unbelievably priced, portioned, and decorated. Tasty, too. Literally and not-at-all hyperbolically unbelievably tasty. Unbelievable."
4,1,"Brickyard Gaastropub is a great place to grab a tasty brew and some tasty morsels in Hell's Kitchen. ??They have 24 beers on tap, and 30 bottles to choose from. I've had brunch, bar food, and dinner here. ??All of the meals I've had here have been great. ??The Irish Bacon is a great addition to any brunch entree, the sliders are tasty, the chicken under a brick is a great dinner option, and the bread pudding is an awesome dessert option to be shared.

As far as a great place to enjoy craft beers go, as well as to enjoy a snack or a full meal, the Brickyard Gastropub can't be beat in HK. Cheers!"
4,1,"I have finally had my fourth dinner at Gramercy Tavern and can talk about it. Gramercy Tavern is a icon in New York so everyone must go at least once. The place is quite comfortable, nice bar and comfortable dining room. Every time I go it reminds me of the Four Seasons where the servers and staff are very proper and correct. Gramercy is identical. You won't find your neighborhood bartender here. The food is well executed and is always good; never a bad meal here. However the menu is Pre-Fixe which makes the experience more limited and you would not be able to eat here weekly unless you wanted to eat the same things. Keep mind the portions here are never large but adequate. Do not plan on a Morton Steakhouse dinner here. Great wine list, very good cocktails. Great for a special occasion, groups."
3,1,"Five stars for the old Calle Ocho, three stars for the new. Calle Ocho recently moved into a new space in the Excelsior hotel, and a lot more changed than just the location. Instead of a self serve sangria bar with 8 choices at brunch, they now have seven and you have to order it through your server. It's still complimentary, but you can't just get up and get a new glass at your convenience. They also have drafted a list of rules such as one glass of sangria at a time, and you have to stay within their time limit, although they don't specify what that is but will ""let you know if you are approaching it."" They still give you the amazing assortment of breads with strawberry butter when you sit down, and the entrees are still pretty tasty and a decent price (esp since they come with free sangria). They have the same, latin-american menu, and I usually get the burrito with eggs, beans, and chorizo inside. It's always delicious but the cheese on top wasn't melted this time and they could have been a little heavier handed with the salsa. The sangria was decently strong and tasty as always but the new system posed a problem since our server wasn't the best. He would disappear for long periods of time, so we had to wait forever for a new glass, and they only put two pieces of the boozy fruit in each. We also asked him for several things which he said he would bring and just never did. This used to be a favorite for brunch but terrible service and new ""rules"" considered, I may take my business to one of the other hundreds of boozy brunches in the city."
4,1,"One of the best Indian restaurants in TriBeCa! There are so many hole-in-the-wall Indian joints in the area, and sometimes I'm a bit reluctant to walk-in because they look dirty and the food is usually sitting out the whole afternoon. Benares, on the other hand, has a nice ambiance when you walk in, and they offer generous portion sizes. The prices are a bit high, but I usually get the pre-fixe dinner special that includes rice, naan, an appetizer, and an entree for about $17 that makes it quite reasonable. Because the portion sizes are large, I can easily split this meal with another friend or make 2 meals out of it. Just beware that ""medium"" spiciness is really spicy. I will definitely order from here again!"
5,-1,"Sunday morning walking around in a dull, fog and saw something called Quiche Italiano for brunch. A good strong cup of joe, a slice of quiche, some Motown tunes, a couple of chocolate-dipped Madeleines and Cafe Lore made Sunday look a lot better. Great service in a familiar, relaxed atmosphere. No rush and a little fuss, but these guys have the fuss down to a science and make you feel at home. Almost took my shoes off during my cappuccino. A really enjoyable experience. The menu is simple but covers some great comfort foods, from french toast for breakfast to eggplant rollotini for lunch to mushroom ravioli for dinner to pineapple cheesecake for dessert. In the middle of Sunset Park, Brooklyn grows a really cool restaurant that is a breathe of fresh air."
4,1,"I walk by Olivier's every day on my way to and from the train. This owner operated business has transformed a once skeezy pizza joint into a lovely and charming French bistro. The tiled floors and bistro table offer a quaint old world Brooklyn/ Euro vibe.The menu is rich and elaborate. Olivier's French influence can be tasted in every dish. I've only been for brunch, but the dinner menu looks fantastic. The quiche was light and airy- yet rich. The side salad complemented the meal well. The house dressing wasn't too sweet. The staff is attentive and personable. ??and of course, delish coffee--and lots of coffee/latte/cappuccino options. A lovely but hidden addition to the neighborhood!"
5,-1,"I found this amazing gem of a restaurant while waiting for a friend to meet me at another place. I was early for my friend, so popped into Cielo for a drink. I was awed by the atmosphere, friendliness and superior food! This place is wonderful. The owner/manager Isabella is so warm and welcoming that I ended up having my friend meet me at Cielo instead of our original destination. Now I'm a confirmed fan and will be a die-hard regular. Don't miss this place!"
4,1,"Some great food, some stuff we didn't like-the calamari and seafood tasted like nothing. Someone in my group used the word Alpo. The empanadas and cod were amazing. My boyfriend wants to return just for them. Our waitress was extremely sweet and accommodating-even with our group of 7. Sangria was great, and they had mango and a pomegranate option. The flamenco show was good for something different, but became almost too loud ??as we were seated right next to the stage. The price is great and came out to about 65 pp with a twenty percent tip. Glad I tried it out."
3,1,"I had Friday night dinner here with my mom when she was in town. Very popular and crowded place and the website said they didn't take reservations so we ended up waiting around for about an hour for a table. The food was OK. Mom got the fried chicken and I got the duck meatloaf, but will have to say that both were a bit salty. The cider was good,but dessert was the best thing about this place. Overall, solid meal, but not as great as I expected considering all the RAVE reviews. Oh yea. Service sucked."
5,1,"Delicious addition to the neighborhood. I had two tacos and am looking forward to trying the other two and the rice bowls (not a big burrito fan). The pork was delicious. The falafel was good but not quite as fine, but I'd happily eat it again. I was warned the pork was spicy but it wasn't thru the roof, which is good with me. They were fast and courteous and the place is clean. I'll be back soon!! Just had the chicken kimchi bowl, really really good. The staff is super nice. They keep adding menu items and I never get tired of the food. It's not a linger and dine sort of restaurant, better for take-out or a quick bite, but it's really really good."
5,1,"Well worth a trip to Greenpoint. ??The interior looks inviting but we were seated in the garden which is one of the best in NYC. ??You'll eat your meal surrounded by plants and herbs, with members of staff actually coming out to snip a few for the dishes. ??If that sounds gimmicky, don't let me put you off - because Anella is much better than that. ??The food is interesting, inventive and delicious, even if you don't care that it also ticks all the local, artisanal, seasonal boxes too."
5,-1,"Some of the best pickle chutney I have ever tasted. ?? The dosas are perfect. ??I HIGHLY recommend this place, best Indian food I have had in a long time."
4,-1,The ramen was good but not as good as I thought. Pork bun very really delicious.
2,-1,"I went here about a year ago and I'm pretty sure my body is still trying to digest the pork. ?? Starts off fine, if you can stand the uber-hip vibe and long wait at the bar. The beer was cheap. As in it makes no sense for Manhattan cheap. Ah, the next round was double the price. Wuh ? Turns out it was half price happy hour when I first arrived. No notice from the bartender that if we order in the next five minutes we can get the deal before the price goes up. Thanks. Probably I wasn't cool enough to receive the message. But the pork buns ordered while hunkering down for the long table wait were excellent. Note the word pork. It will come back to haunt me. Table in some room straight back then left and then left again. So what to eat. Pork the waiter suggests. Some soup with pork in it. And add in some extra belly fat while you're at it. OK. And so it goes. I think I heard a pig screaming in the kitchen at one point during my meal. Dessert. What ? No pork Ice Cream. Disappointing. I kept it all down which was a triumph. Order with some more discretion than I and you may have a fonder memory. Me, I may never eat pork again. And if I do it won't be here."
4,1,"Great place to pick up a delicious, fast dinner!"
4,-1,"Good, but not my fave Greek restaurant. Food is very fresh and elegant, ??but ever so slightly bland. I'm not sure what was missing, just hint more of seasoning or something. Having said that, we did enjoy everything we ate, but have had better. The complimentary pita is fresh and delicious, but the chickpea spread is bland. Dolmades were very good ??as were the dips. I'd pass on the cold pepper stuffed with cheese. Bass entree with pistachio crust was great, very fresh and delicate. But again, just a tad bland. I wasn't crazy for the spinach, celery veg that accompanied it. Service was friendly and professional. Atmosphere is lovely and great for a date. Good food that lacked bit of magic."
3,-1,"I was excited to go to this place after all the hype I hear and seeing the constant posts of people going there and raving about the ramen. I attempted to go to this place 4 times before I actually ate here. Each of the first four times I gave up as the wait was over an hour and given to many food options in that adjacent blocks I always opted to go somewhere else. When I finally actually here I was disappointed. The ramen is average and their is nothing special about it at all. There are MANY ramen spots that have comparable quality at a FRACTION of the price. The decor is nice, the waiter was polite."
4,1,"This place is good. Our food was good and I loved my cocktail despite another reviewer claiming they were average. First off, the ambiance is nicer than I had anticipated. It looks nice while still being approachable. Good for a date but still welcoming to families. To be honest, it was nice to see some families eating together. ??So overall, nice, but not pretentious. It was just my husband and I. He had made a reservation on OpenTable and we were seated right away. Our food was good. Not amazing, but the service was great, making this a very solid 4 star review (probably 4.5 but I feel like I need to scale back my 5 star ratings). According to our receipt Emily was our server and she was super friendly and welcoming with great recommendations. Throughout the meal we had a few different people clearing our plates, delivering food and checking on us, so it seems like a nice collaborative place to work. As a former server I always appreciate those good vibes and we were well cared for. To drink I had the Scarlet's Fever. It was DELICIOUS and different than my usual, but so refreshing without being too sweet (it was also Emily's recommendation). To eat I had the gazpacho, which was a bit disappointing. I would give it 2.5 stars but I then had a special, the grilled squid with canelloni which was smoky, warm, and satisfying. The two starters more than satisfied me and I even had some canelloni remaining. My husband had the cavatelli. Deep, rich flavor. Also, the olive oil they serve with bread when you arrive seems to be garlic infused and was a nice touch. We left satisfied and happy. Overall the awesome service maybe even outshone our food."
5,-1,"We were looking for a new place to dine in my neighborhood and discovered Porteno as a result of a web search. ??We visited ??Buenos Aires several years ago so the advertised Argentinian cuisine was the draw. ??Went there on 11/15/12 but the place was full so yes, do make reservations. It's a small place and does fill up fast. ??Went back the next night with reservations for 4 and found it to be a friendly, reasonably priced restaurant serving delicious well-prepared food. The wait staff was pleasant and Jorge, one of the owners, was a friendly gracious host. ??There were some rather loud diners near us for the first half of our meal, but luckily there was no loud music blaring in the restaurant and I commend Jorge for not subjecting us to that torture. We had a sampling of starter plates: Polenta Porteno (polenta with blood sausage meat): interesting dish but may be an acquired taste for some, two types of empanadas (beef; spinach w/manchego): tasty morsels inside a delicate puff-pastry, and the octopus salad special, which was SUPERB! I try to have octopus whenever I see it on the menu but all too frequently it is either chewy, slimy, fishy or all of the above. ??This was tender and grilled to perfection and not fishy tasting at all - even those at our table who are usually not fond of octopus found it delightful. For entrees diners at our table had the ribeye (bife de costilla), grilled tender steak served with a kale and bean salad (one of the two diners found the kale too crispy-raw, the other enjoyed it). ??Another diner had Milanese, breaded and fried and also tender and tasty, and I had the rolled flank steak (metambrito), a braciole-like dish that melted in your mouth and was my favorite (yes, I did taste all the other entrees). Wine was a bottle of Argentinian Chardonnay which was ok and a bottle of malbec which was a smooth pleasant wine. ??Both were in the $30 range. We tried two desserts: avocado custard (flan de palta), light and delicate, and bread pudding with dulce de leche gelato (budin de pan), which I found not to be the perfect choice after a steak dinner as it is a bit on the heavy side. Overall a delightful dining experience."
5,1,Joju is a great place to eat! Every sandwich is delicious! Sandwiches are a good portion and taste fresh! yummy!
5,1,"Excellent argentinian place for dinner!! I am Argentinian, and am really used to good stakes, but the entrania here was really over the top!! Had the best dinner ever, and the place has a really nice vibe."
4,1,The lamb burger. ??Hands down best lamb burger I've had.
5,1,I cannot describe how happy i was when the waiter realized i wasnt touching the breadsticks and informed me they were gluten free!! So many gf options!! They even put little flags in then gf paninis!
5,-1,"Really great food. Worth the extra cash. Lamb chops are the most tender and flavorful I've ever had, delicious teas and salad, candy bar desert was unreal - and I despise desert. Service was first rate. Only downside is that the kafte is god awful and should probably be banished from the city."
1,1,"If I could give a negative I would!!! Dear managers and staff- I will NEVER come back to this place!! How dare you add additional tip for awful service?? This goes especially to the bartender who added it: NOOK- you should be ashamed! ??you weren't amazing so you shouldn't havent added the extra tip. What makes the situation even more disgusting is I attempted to reach out to the manager and she made a joke of it and hung up the phone. There are 50 other Thai places in the neighborhood. The food is not any different from what other thai places can make- it's only the decor that stands out, so please don't pride yourself on the food or the service because both are whack!"
5,1,"My family had dinner here for our mothers 59th birthday. ??None of us had been to Blend on the Water before this but we were looking for good food and a nice ambiance and used our online searching skills. ??Needless to say, we found everything we were looking for at Blend on the Water. ??The view was gorgeous, the food was delicious and most of all, our server, Alexis, was a hit with everyone from my 14 year old nephew to my 70 year old grandmother. ?? Between all of us, we ate everything from the chorizo mac and cheese to the tender and flaky salmon and drank everything from the house wine to specialty drinks. ??Everything was well cooked, tasty and served by a wonderful staff. Our server, Alexis, was amazing and if we ever go back we will make it a point to request her specifically."
5,-1,"This by far is my favorite NYC restaurant. ??The sangria is excellent the tapas are beyond stellar. ??My favs on the menu include the Brussle sprouts, short ribs, bacon wrapped dates. The pork empanadas. ??Pretty much have enjoyed everything I've ever ordered on the menu sans the Sliders and warm vegetable salad. ??Live in Austin now but whenever I visit NYC I always hit it up."
4,1,"Even Paul Verlaine himself will wax poetic for the signature Hanoi martini (vodka, lychee and pineapple). ??And at $5 until 10 p.m., that poem will probably be longer than the Mahabharata. ??And reasonably expected to be full of inappropriateness. The award for ""Best Idea"" ever goes to whoever decided to head over to Verlaine as everyone was dying of thirst after a rum event. :) The martinis were potent, nobody kvetched on the size of the drink or the lack of alcohol it contained and pretty soon comments that should remain in the confines of one's minds made it to one's lips. Marie Antoinette does not need to issue an invite and even without cake, we'd gladly flock to this place. ??Verlaine has cachaca, Rittenhouse and a tapas menu that should probably be tried at some point. L'amour."
5,-1,"Very nice place, cozy, excellent food and great service. I tried the tasting menu and the food was excellent, every single dish was just great. Everyone from the maitre d' to the sommelier was nice and the overall service was excellent. Would definetely recommend it."
5,1,"We sat up at the counter and watched the meat sizzle (smells amazing) and fresh ingredients get placed into several exciting dishes. ??We had fish fermented for 4 days that came out crispy and full of flavor. ?? That was a special that is done once a week. ??We had the large plate curry lamb dish that is always on the menu. ??It was sort of like a kabob with the lamb cooked perfectly, roti as a shell, pickled beet and a yogurt sauce. ??The whole thing does not get soggy and does not fall apart. ??That is a major achievement. ??Sizzling sisig. ?? ??This dish sounds a little scary but is best described as crispy well seasoned pig bits on a cast iron dish. ??It is incredible. Prepare to drink beer or wine. ??There are enough choices of each and will continue to improve as they have only been open for a short time."
5,1,"Boqueria is a great place to take your best friend from forever out to have a girlie gabfest after a hot stone massage. ??So that's just what we did! We were relaxed and slightly stunned from our massages at Supple Spa next door (see my review of SS as well!), and walked into Boqueria for some sustenance. ??It was bustling with a vibrant, young crowd, but we were whisked away to a two-top table and our handsome server with an unplacable accent explained the specials. We chose mostly from the specials menu, which makes me sad that I may not be able to experience that deliciousness next time (and there will be a next time!). ??I'm writing up the dishes from memory because I can't find the specials on the website - sad!! 1. ??We started with a salad that I'm still dreaming about: ??beautiful chopped lettuces, jamon, shaved manchego, and HAZELNUT vinaigrette. ??SO GOOD. ??Seriously, this is haunting my dreams. ??I can still taste the slight crunch from the hazelnuts and the astringency of the vinaigrette piercing through the decadent richness of the jamon. 2. Next, we had a grilled flatbread that had some goat cheese, arugula, more jamon, and a runny quail egg on top. ??Drool-icious.... 3. ??Third course consisted of two enormous, perfectly cooked scallops. ??They were silky and opalescent on the inside, and crispy and crunchy on the outside. ??I think they may have been coated and deep fried, but tasted amazingly light. ??The perfect scallop! 4. ??We finished with a more traditional tapas - a sausage and white bean dish. ??The sausages were house made that day and tasted fresh and faintly herbaceous. ??The white beans were large, meaty, and had a good firm mouth feel. Before floating away to catch the PATH train back to Jersey, we shared a flan. ??Brought back memories from the old days when my friend had to make flan for Spanish class. ??The flan was luscious, creamy, and gone too fast! Reasonably priced - but neither of us was drinking. ??Would make an amazing date with a significant other - or a great friend! - or bring another couple and try twice as many dishes. :-)"
4,-1,excellent pre fixe menu for brunch. ??make sure to get the filet mignon or the fejoada order with a bloody mary. ??Order the steak medium rare and it will be perfect...Definitly not to red. LOL JACKET REQUIRED.......NOT
5,-1,"My husband and I decided to try Casablanca after reading the reviews on this site, and we were not disappointed! We started with the eggplant salad, which was delicious. For our entrees I had the chicken with couscous and my husband had lamb tagine. Both dishes were flavorful and delicious. We also had the tea, and as many others stated in their reviews, it was great. ??In addition to the great food, the service was fantastic. The waitress was incredibly friendly and attentive, and took the time to explain the menu to us in detail. ??I would highly recommend this restaurant."
5,-1,gangster.
5,1,"This place was great. ??Total surprise. ??Just make sure you walk thru the lobby of 211 and don't go to the place next door, which we almost did. Walked down and thought I was going into a bomb shelter. ??Boy was I pleasantly surprised. ??Great ambiance. ??Felt like I had just uncovered this great hidden surprise in NYC. Esp since I worked 3 blocks away for 4 yrs and never knew about it. ??Had a variety of dishes and sakes. ??All was great. ??Fish - black cod and fluke were esp. great. ??But also steak and pork belly are must haves. ??Total find and total surprise. ??Lots of fun."
1,1,"Not worth it. The wait was so long as there was no reservation available. No place to sit while you wait. I stood and kept getting hit by the customers and waiters coming through. The head waiter kept telling us that our table was almost ready when it actually wasn't. Finally we are seated. To even get a waiter's attention was SO difficult that I contemplated leaving. But since I had already waited an hour for this place, what is another 10+ minutes? We ordered. Water does not come until our food comes. AND my ravenous self was staring at the tables near us, THEY ALL GOT BREAD. WHERE WAS OUR BREAD?!?!? Anyways, so my friend and I got the tagliatelle bolognese as well as the pork belly. Pork belly was just all fat. NO meat. What kind of dish is this?! I understand that pork belly has a lot of fat.. I've eaten it at a lot of places. But if I order the entree version, I expect some meat on it! The tagliatelle was less disappointing. It was a homecooked pasta, something you can make yourself. Not exciting. Not innovative. But this place isn't that. I recommend it if you want a down to earth meal. But you can get this pasta anywhere else in the city, don't suffer through this long wait and horrible service for it."
4,-1,"I just found this place last week, even if i am ??a soho restaurants fun. This is going to be my favorite new spot. I love it 100 %. The food, the staff, the vibe, the decoration!! It all good about this place!! Sometimes is not easy to find a table."
4,1,"Jane is such a cute little spot for lunch. ??The low-key, bistro-like atmosphere is really welcoming, and the menu is packed with delicious options. ??One of my favorite items is a divine goat cheese-avocado sandwich. ??The atmosphere is relaxing, and it's fun to watch passersby on Houston Street. ??I'd highly recommend Jane for a lunch with friends or even a more casual business lunch."

5,1,"This place has been on my bucket list for a while now ever since my friends raved of the boil. I finally got to try it today and I was not disappointed.. At all. We had to wait to an hour and a half so my friends and I walked around chinatown wasting time. It was really convenient that they texted us when our table was ready. My friends and I ordered the Cajun fries as an appetizer and it was pretty good with the dip that it came with. We all ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of clams and I had it with the boil special sauce on a mild spicy level. The boil special sauce is soo good, there's nothing like it. The shrimps were huge and there was more than enough food for 3 people. The clams were pretty good too even though the shells itself made up most of the weight. All in all, I would highly recommend this place. It's amazing and I can't wait to come back."
4,-1,"People make a big deal out of this place and, as a result, it's always busy, busy, busy. But if you're craving pancakes on a Sunday morning, and who doesn't every now and then, this place is your ultimate destination. The lemon pancakes are tops, as is the french toast. You really can't go wrong."
2,-1,"I had their coconut bubble tea, it was horrible. But boba was hard as if it had been out for days, and the tea it self tasted burnt and it was barley sweetened. I was disappointed to know that they did not serve warm bubble tea, since it is cold outside. Many other bubble tea places that I have tried have been much better, for a better price, and have had both hot and cold bubble tea options. I did not try anything else in the restaurant but the place did smell nice and was very nicely decorated."
2,1,"An out-of-town friend and I loooooove Korean food. ??So for his last visit, I made a dinner reservation. The decor confused me - Van Gogh smoking a pipe? ??The phases of the moon? ??Birch tree trunks? ??Swings? ??Scratching my head Our waitress was perky and hyperactive at first, and then I guess she ran out of energy after she took our order because we didn't see her again except to ask for the check. We ordered more than enough food, so that when the chicken meatballs we ordered did not arrive and we were billed for it, we told them it wasn't a big deal. ??They struck it from the bill and wrapped it to go. My favorite things were the sweet potato noodles and the bulgogi. ??However, I'd rather go to 32nd St for more flavor and bigger portions."
5,1,The salon here was the best salmon I've ever had!!!! $7 glass of Zweigelt was an amazing deal as well.
5,1,"One of my favorites in the city. ??It's not at all authentic Tapas, but a loving reinvention and update of many classics. ??(It's very much a Batali-Bastianich place - the tables are even the same as the bar room at Becco) I get to Spain every year, but the patatas bravas here are the best I have ever had - and still I hardly ever order them because I like to get the beautiful fingerling potatoes with truffles and a fried duck egg... ??It's totally cramped and small - but who cares when the food is this good. ??I like to go at an off hour like 3pm and have the place to myself - I only have had one reservation here, the second week it opened. ??You can easily eat vegetarian very well here (or extremely meaty) - every person I've ever taken here has adored it."
2,1,"Always a long line of hungry hipsters mulling around outside, waiting for a table to open up, no matter what day of the week it is. It was packed with 30min wait, on a Tuesday afternoon. This is gotta be good, right? If atmosphere alone was enough to satisfy me, it would be 5-star. You can feel that everyone wants to be there, but importantly the staff don't carry a knowing pretentious attitude about it. My server and the host were very friendly, and gave me perfect service. Thanks guys. Unfortunately though, I was disappointed with the smoked salmon benny, and my diner-quality coffee. Presentation wasn't very interesting, they slapped a single layer of smoked salmon across two biscuits and topped it with eggs and hollandaise. Not saying a benny is supposed to be much more than that, but considering how much everyone raves about this place, I expected a little more creativity. The smoked salmon was good, but certainly not the best I've ever had. The biscuits, which are highly reviewed on Yelp, were dry, even when drenched in yolk and hollandaise, so I didn't finish them. One of my eggs was more medium than soft, leaving me wanting more yolk. Coffee is run of the mill diner quality brew. I didn't really want it once I started drinking it. At least I can say the hollandaise was delicious, beautiful consistency, and very, very tart. Other things on the menu looked interesting. I suggest you do not order the benny, and see if anything else can impress."
4,-1,"I came here for a first date on a Friday night. The moment you walk in you are hit with the smell of apples from the coat room as there are apples lining the walls. It was nice, my date was a bit late so I got to sit in the front room to wait. The crowd in that area was really old (no offense old people) but it seemed slightly stuffy to me. But when my date arrived and we entered the main restaurant I saw a lot more younger people and it had a bit more energy as well. We had the table near the back that had both seats facing the same direction which always kind of annoys me, especially tonight since my date was lookin so good. The food was delicious, service was amazing and decor was great. I would definitely come back here again, maybe just for a special occasion since it's a bit pricey."
3,-1,Lovely drinks but come on god sake we are in lower east side lower the prices little bit haa:) Other than that good food and ok atmosphere ( for single female not so good)

5,1,"This mom and pop/hole in the wall shop has some DELICIOUS cuban/dominican food. The exterior isn't really inviting but the people here are super friendly and the food totally hits the spot. I got take out from here (see pictures) and portions are generous, although hugely carb heavy: - Hot oxtail special (on Mondays) $11 very tender. Given that it's oxtail there's not that much meat to begin with. But I was happy with the portions especially since the oxtail sauce was so good over rice. It came with black or pinto beans and yellow or white rice. LOTS of rice and not as much beans. - Beef noodle soup special (on Mondays) $4 for a small portion. Kinda salty but good flavor. Had potatoes, onions, celery, carrots, beef chunks and rice (instead of noodle I guess). Don't think I would get this again since $4 isn't really worth it but still had good flavor and hits the spot if you're craving something to drink. - Plantains $4. THEY GIVE YOU SO MUCH PLANTAINS.. and it's cooked just right (sometimes plantains are too hard). Can't wait to eat my leftovers tomorrow. If anything, this was most worth it. - Small avocado salad $2. They're probably not making much money off of this if at all, cause they gave me a small container of cut avocado .. and it's pretty much about a whole avocado. Good to eat with rice and all the other cuban stuff. For I think $4 you can get it with salad and dressing and all. Would highly recommend take out. I wouldn't want to eat in unless I had nowhere else to go. And I didn't order delivery so not sure how the quality is there. Don't let the outside fool you. One of the most affordable, authentic, delicious cuban eats around. You'll probably want to hit the gym afterwards though cause it's hard to put that fork down ;)"
4,-1,Food is good. Price is cheap. Place is a bit too small. Not for the claustrophobic.

1,1,"Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the food for this place as my wife, my four year old daughter and I did not even get the chance to try it. I tried making reservations on Saturday, April 5, 2014, prior to going but the hostess said the manager was not letting her take any more reservations but that we could still come as walk-ins and we ""will"" be seated. This place is not family friendly as it TOO loud, ??it's more like a bar/club. The drinks were OK, even though that's not why we went. We got there around 8:30 PM and we're told that the wait was about two hours. Being the optimist that I am and the fact that I was really looking forward to front their food, as I have seen that it looks good on their Instagram account, ??I didn't see that as a bad thing and was willing to wait. My wife and I had a few drinks and I kept asking how much longer and all the hostess kept saying not much longer, the last time I asked she said there are some people that are done but we can't make them leave, which I understand. I kept seeing people come in and get seated within minutes so my patience and optimism were already running low. I finally asked some guy who appeared to be a manager if I was being dicked around and all he said they had reservations--but to me it seemed like these were personal friends by the way they weer being greeted. ??After almost three hours I finally told my wrote I had enough and we left (around 11:23 and the place closes at 11:30). All we were asked as we were walking out was if everything was ok. Bottom line, the least they could have said was that they were completely booked and not accepting walk-ins or they could not guarantee seating. Oh did I mention my daughter fell asleep and that we were in town on a business trip, from Miami, ??and took a cab from Manhattan where there were more than plenty of restaurants we could have gone to. I would say I would give it another chance but one time is all it takes and going by this experience I wouldn't even go just to have drinks nor recommend it to anyone else. I'm usually not one to give reviews and if I do they're usually well deserved and not negative but this one was worthy of and warranted such review. Not everyone is meant to be in the customer service/ hospitality/ restaurant business and if they decide to, they should at least invest in professional training."
4,1,"this diner is always packed, so i was so relieved when i walked in and immediately got a table. my bf and i had already eaten dinner, so this was just a dessert pit stop. they are known for their enormous portions, but they are better known for their delish cheesecakes...and delish they are! we ordered a slice of chocoloate swirl cheesecake and although i still think the fresh banana creme cheesecake from the cheesecake factory is ever so slightly better, this can definitely hold up on its own. the cake was super dense and extremely decadent, just the way a good cheesecake should be. one slice is plenty for two, unless you plan to have it for dinner, which isn't such a bad idea..."
5,-1,This is one of the cheapest place for anyone to get a full meal. You can virtually order anything on the menu and you'll never regret it. The specialty here is chicken so if you want to get the full experience try the chicken platter.
1,-1,Rude service. Poor value. Over-hyped - only thing it has going for it is the convenient location. You're far better off going down to other store for banh-mi sandwiches for $4-5. I ordered a duroc pulled pork sandwich. Bread to meat ratio was too low. Bread was hard and created the squeezing of meat out the other end effect. Pork was also bland. Nothing special - not worth the price.VERY BAD
2,1,I'm sorry but I don't get the hype. The line is so long but there a MILLION better places for brunch in Astoria. I've been three times and always left disappointed.
4,-1,"After a day of shopping with friends we stopped in for a quick bite and drinks. ??What a great little bistro! ??The staff were very accommodating of our party of five.... very courteous and attentive. ??The owner even came over to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. ??Each of our meals were delicious. ??Some of us ordered ""bistro classics"" while others really enjoyed some more modern/creative dishes. Needless to say, we ended up eating off of each other's plates. ??The waitress noticed what we were doing and instead of being frowned upon she actually brought us extra plates and silverware -- so nice. ??I can't wait to go back with my husband and will definitely tell my friends and colleagues about this hidden gem! ?? After having such a pleasurable experience at Bistro Les Amis I had to write a review and ended up reading through some of the others written before me, most all of which were positive and complimentary. ??I have to say that I'm a bit confused and taken aback by the review left by H.G. of Montauk. ??It seems to be such an angry, personal attack rather than a review of his or her dining experience. ??A shame that the avenue given with Yelp for sharing personal experiences and recommendations is used by some in very petty and hurtful ways."
4,-1,"We have been wanting to try this spot for a while and we expected it would be busy since its a sat. night but it was insanely busy. The hostess (who is hot by the way) ??Maya ??was so awesome and chill. She told us the wait was an hour but but would try to get us in sooner and put us on the wait list. We got a txt 20min later saying our table was ready which was perfect since our drinks just came. Her Host sat us but a few minutes later i found out we had 1 more person coming ??even though they were packed as soon as i went and ??told her (not thinking she could do much) she found a chair in like 2 seconds and twisted our table to somehow walla fit 5 of us. Love her!!! ??Beer, Bacon, Bourbon!!!!! Our server Mike was was kool as well everything he recommended was on point! The Drinks here are Strong but no complaints!! Must Try Egg BLT and Bacon flight !!! The game was on multiple screens and the music was chill Over all we are already planning on our next weekend Bar ??Bacon night!!!!!"
4,-1,I have been a regular on Saturday nights for a while now and I have to say the husband and wife team are amazing. The last 2 weekends are not the same with out the team. The husband and wife team is the best. BRING BACK THE SATURDAY NIGHT TEAM!!! WE ALL MISS THAT TEAM!!!
4,1,"Went there for dinner during the week. Food was awesome. The GRILLED SIRLOIN was amazing, as well as, a few of the sides. The self serve bottomless draft was perfect, such a great idea. Service was nice and the evening I was there they played hiphop all night. Was just a great experience for dinner."
4,-1,Great service - yummy brunch :)
5,1,"Great for groups, especially if you can secure a table upstairs behind the kitchen. ??Not for those with bland or unadventurous palates!"
5,-1,I love this place omg please please come here they staff is fantastic the food is outta this world and I love that atmosphere it a cool clam place . if your in the mood for a great place lovley food and great music to listen come her
5,-1,"Hooray for Paulie Gee's. Napoli style pizza made with love. Lovely interior. Hope that liquor license comes in soon! It's the only way this place could get better. Ask for the off-menu vegan cheese -- Paulie will make the pizza himself to ensure it's up to standard with the regular pies. Thanks for the Daiya, Paulie! Will come back again and again and again."
4,-1,"Cramped, loud, and a bit of a wait on a Friday night.. buuuut, once we sat down, I was digging the vibe. Great mojitos, friendly service and reasonably priced dishes. Recommendation: Ropa vieja... delish!"
4,-1,Food is tasty and decently portioned. ??Prices are reasonable although the cash only thing is a hassle. ??Expect it to be loud & crowded. ??The only time it wasn't was when 2 friends and I went exactly at opening at 4pm. ??Last thing I ordered was Massaman red ??curry and it was delish.
4,1,this is a cool place to go to learn a lil somthing about wine ??and have a great little snack. we had the tom basil and egg bruscetta. ??it was worth the $10 cab ride. the beet and gorgonzola ??rissotto balls were good as well. but the bruscetta was the home run of the afternoon.
4,-1,everything I have tried is good. it does seem to take a bit too long when ordering a sandwich and there is one other person in there. great on those lazy days when i just don't want to cook but still want healthy food this is a great option. the owner is nice as is the staff.
5,1,I loved this place!! ??I just moved to the neighborhood. A neighbor recommended this place to me and I went for brunch this weekend. ??Everyone was really friendly and we got our food quickly and it was delicious. ??I highly recommend the french toast. ??While they were fast there was also no pressure to leave. ??I could have stayed as long as I like. ??I totally recommend this place and I will definitely be back. Often!
3,1,"Ambience was nice and enjoyed the small dishes. ??I recommend you should eat before you come here. ??If not, it will cost you $$$. I will repost/edit this once I go back there for the tasting menu."
5,-1,This place is great.what I really like about it ??that his food is very different from others and every item he has at his restaurant is unique so if you ever ??around give this guy a try and you won't be disappointed .
3,1,"Went here with my wife for my birthday. I'd characterize everything here was 'well composed'. The atmosphere was good. The interior tasteful and comfortable. The mix of people surprised me, from one or two younger hipster types to older grey haired UES patrician types. Perhaps more on the older side than young. The food was balanced and nicely presented, if not blindingly innovative, or challenging, or stand out tasty. I had the prawns to start (they were fine), the lamb for main (undercooked and somewhat unimaginative) and a cake of sorts for desert (nicely presented but forgettable). GT is the sort of place Jack Donaghy (from TV show 30 Rock) would come to enjoy a meal away from the rabble and without any nasty surprises. The service was superb. And they did all they could to make our evening comfortable. Glad I ate here, but ??I'm not in any rush to return. For me I like to be more surprised by the combination of ingredients and flavors. And I know when I do want to return, GT will be there."
5,1,"A delicious Colombian/Venezuelan delicacy. Mellow atmosphere, delicious sangria, excellent lunch specials. The Mami (Spicy Pork) and the Veggie Arepas are personal favorites. An Astoria institution. Get some."
4,-1,Best late night hop before heading home. Totally delicious. A must-have when in the Village.
5,1,"Got the hummus pizza, pork buns, and bottle of malbec. All amazing. Everything they say about here is true. You have to get lucky for seating."
5,-1,"I remember when I first visited this place only had about 10 or so reviews, and it brought a grin to my face to see that the number of reviews has grown to 100. I recently went back after I was in New York again. Both times I got a panini here (deliciozo and then bubi), and both times I thought the panini was absolutely delicious and reasonably priced. The chef/owner is awesome, and I wish her continued success!"
4,-1,"One of the burgers I've ever had, no exxaggeration. Brownie sundae dessert was to die for. Very pricey but amazing meal!"
5,1,"You gotta check this place out! I mean it! Now I know why this restaurant was rated 4.5 stars out of 5 prior to dining here. Excellent food with excellent service. To start off, I changed the reservation time because some of my friends were going to be late. Once I called them several hours prior to dinner, they said ""No problem. See you then!"" Once I got there, about half the party was 30 minutes late or more. So once, I got there, I sat by the bar area to grab a drink with one of my friends that showed up on time. The staff could have easily given up that table to someone else, considering how many different people came in trying to get a table. They didn't do that and kept their word on holding the table till at least half of us arrived. That shows how much they care about their customers. Now, regarding the food, we started off with some empanadas and polenta. I was waiting to have a high quality empanada and it was muy delicioso!! The breading on the outside was light and fluffy and the inside of the empanada, whether it was spinach, corn or beef was cooked perfectly. Already felt like I was in heaven. As for the entree, I have been waiting a long time to have Argentinian steak because it's not cooked and prepared in the same way as the American style steakhouses here. It's also not so much the melts in your mouth type steak, but it is very juicy and tasty. Once I ordered it and took my first bite, well, my wish was granted. I will have to thank the genie in a bottle later on. Here are a few notes for anybody reading this. This is NOT a place to bring a large party, no more than 6 people, unless you plan to reserve the whole restaurant. This place does not sit more than about 20-25 people, including the bar area. It's a great date restaurant. The place is small, but has a very cozy and homely feel."
4,1,"Im basing this rating mainly on the fried chicken since i didnt have the chance to try out the pies. FRIED CHICKEN....absolutely juicy..... the inside was just glistening with amazingness. Not only was it juicy on the inside but the outside skin was magically crispy and flavorful. i ate so much that i could barely even breathe when i got up. although, as i was walked through the hallway and ??passed the kitchen area... the intoxicating aroma of the fried chicken made me want to purchase at least one more thigh. MAC AND CHEESE it was just okay to me, nothing mind blowing. i believe they added a touch of hot sauce on top of it to add a little tang which did help BISCUIT definitely was not a fan of it. just too dense for my taste. i actually rather have biscuits from poppeyes or kfc OVERALL.... i will be back to try out the actual pies but will definitely be back for more of that fried chicken goodness"
5,1,"This place really is very tasty. ??Akamaru Modern ramen and Hirata Buns are the way to go. ??I've had several of their other dishes and it's not bad, but it wouldn't justify the wait. ??If you came and got anything else, you might think this place was overrated."
5,-1,"This place exceeded my expectations! The grilled octopus, sweet potato tots and green tea ice cream were the best I have ever had. The menu is fresh and fun. I will be back soon to check out their lunch specials!"
4,-1,"After a hellish 2-day airport experience coming in from LA, The Double Windsor was my first stop with my pal that lives in Brooklyn. ??The good beer, friendly bartender, and awesome BLT were enough to make me forget my luggage-less night stranded in Philly. ??Im not sure about the no-kids drama, Im an outsider... all I know is I would go back! ?? Seriously, get the BLT."
4,1,"Yes, we waited ~150 minutes for this because all our friends have been coming here and we totally went out of our way to come so we really are gonna stick it out. If the weather is good and you have pleasant company, go to the park down a couple blocks and enjoy yourself while the app updates you on the wait. If the weather stinks and the wait is long, you won't leave in as good a mood as I did. Pancakes were super fluffy as expected, but the sides were crispy, almost caramelized. Smoked salmon scramble was super delicious, soft but not overly runny eggs. I didn't try the greens, but they looked good too! The Farmer's Plate had less stellar eggs, but the sausage was pretty good. The cheese was delicious, the roasted tomatoes more troublesome and unwieldy. Sugar-cured bacon was a good mix of salty and sweet. A little oily but very tasty. Other notes - mad amounts of people were taking off around 2pm so, seriously, just go later if brunch food doesn't have to be the first meal of your day. - i like the raspberry jam they brought out. - fairly reasonable/standard prices (for NYC, I guess? -- my thoughts for whenever I look at the bills in this city). - cash only, fine. - also, they automatically calculate the gratuity. We were a party of 3. I'm not sure why they did this. It's convenient, sure, but also off-putting."
5,-1,"This is my favorite NYC restaurant. The fish tacos remind me of home. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful. This is my last visit for a while. Going back home so I had a delicious ""burger with the lot"". It was perfectly cooked. My friend had oysters and beer and boy were they good. Can't wait to come back to NYC to get some meat pies. The chef said they're a special but she's planning to make it them regular menu item. They were yummy. See you Koala!"
1,-1,"What's a true wonder is how this stingy little place has so many good reviews. The eggs were hard, the portions small and fattening, and despite a trendy limited menu, it's gimmicky, w/ few if any moderately healthy choices. The waiter was a creep, wouldn't give me a bit more coffee to heat up a cold cup (Everyone does that!). And then came for the tip without clearing a thing from the table. For a cash-only place overpriced. And why does my receipt have the name of another restaurant on it?"
4,1,"Amy Ruth's can be entertaining before you even walk in the door! I arrived on a Sunday evening with two friends and waited for about 30 minutes in line. Most of that time was spent at the front of the line, where we were blessed with wafts of waffle as people walked out. There were a handful of empty tables right in the front of the restaurant, but as the doorman/bouncer groused to us, they take so many take-out orders that the kitchen gets backed up and they can't even seat the customers waiting outside. We watched with schadenfreude as one lady skipped the line and walked in, explaining that her companion was inside getting their take-out order, only to come back out empty-handed soon after to discover that the police had written her a ticket for parking in the middle of the street with her flashers on. Fail... Anyway, this place is bigger than it seems! We were eventually seated upstairs. Considering how long it took us to get inside, I thought the food would take forever, but I guess chicken and waffles doesn't take that long to cook. The complimentary cornbread hit all the right spots -- it was soft and tasted like an elevated version of the homemade stuff. I didn't see it on the menu, but I wouldn't mind ordering a whole platter of those next time. I don't actually like fried chicken, but I can be objective about good food, and the fried chicken here was great. The skin was perfectly crispy, while the meat inside was succulent. The waffle was delicious and fluffy. Service here was fast and polite. And I love how all the menu items are named after people!"
5,-1,Mac and cheese was a huge pleaser. But the waffles got me !!! Great food great service. Def coming back.
5,1,Very good cocktails--each meticulously crafted. ??Had the special punch as well and was great and unique! ??We enjoyed sitting at the bar and sipping cocktails on a colder night. Split a few food items and were excellent as well--be prepared for a little extra spice. Excellent naan btw.
5,-1,The food was amazing!!!! The service was fantastic and it is perfect for a family dinner or a date night. It is a charming and quite restaurant with well priced food. We came here for a late night dinner and really enjoyed ourselves. The raviolis are to die for and the eggplant parm was perfect! So happy we came here!!!
4,-1,The rolls are amazing they combine the right amount of indian spices without making them too messy. ??My favorites are chicken tikka and shrimp masala both are amazing. ??My only issue is sometimes the service is slow because they only have 1 person actually making the rolls.
5,-1,We went on a week night so only had a 5min wait. ??The restaurant was packed. Sat inside and was a little crowded but was still okay. The food was absolutely delicious. Looking forward to my next visit already.
5,-1,"I need to post two thank-you's here. The first - to chef Michal Anthony for crafting a meal I won't soon forget. The second - to eateryexpert.com. This website has given me excellent restaurant advice on multiple occasions - with Gramercy Tavern topping the list. Just an all around fantastic meal. The wine list is extraordinarily extensive, the food delicious and the wait staff attentive and precise. We went for the tasting menu which proved to be an excellent decision. Next time I want to try the tavern (I've heard the pulled pork sandwich is worth the price of admission)"
4,-1,"Cool place, prices are cheap enough"
1,-1,"Oh, the stupidity of the average New Yorker desperately trying to be cool (sucks I wasted money here once but had to try it). What an over-rated waste of retail space. It's just a fucking french fries place, guys! Get a meal or learn to cook! I have a ton of condoments at home I can just dip french fries from anywhere in. ""Like OMG, they just have french fries?! I'm like 27 and having only french fries for dinner at 2am! Erm soo hip and coOl!"""
3,-1,"Went to Hillstone last night surprisingly busy for Thursday night...we made reservations for 6:15 and we waited for about 5 min and immediately were seated. Loved the ambiance, the colors, the jazz playing in the background. The food took about 30 minutes however the manager Sophia came to our table and acknowledged that our food would be next...we told her we were celebrating my moms b-day and so at the end the waitress Lindsay surprised us with a delicious dessert. Amazing!! Steaks were delicious and the Brussels sprouts and fries were to die for. Over all great place, not too quiet nor too loud and all the waiters and runner were constantly smiling loved that. Definitely got to check out the bar next time looked like fun..lot of hotties ha."
4,-1,"Being a huge fan of Italian food I always try to find new awesome spots in the city! And recently I found Piccoli Trattoria Place! The food is fantastically delicious in there! Ravioli with mascarpone cream, grilled ??calamari, all kinds of pasta, desserts, breads and gourmet wines - everything's on a top! Great service as well! I'll definitely going back there again soon!"
5,1,Their chicken burger w/ cheddar was one of the best things I've ever eaten. Huge fan. A bit pricey but worth it. Mac & cheese super good.
4,-1,"We decided on the seasonal tasting menu and asked Albaro if he could bring tasting glasses of wine for each course. He was happy to do this and we were blown away by how perfect the pairings were. I was bit worried that he might take advantage and give us the most expensive glass each time. He didn't do this at all. One of the red selections was the more expensive tasting but it was worth every penny and a lovely glass of wine. Each course was great - but the halibut was the highlight course for both of us. So good! You can choose any dessert you like and I had the peanut butter semifreddo. If you love peanut butter, you MUST order it. We also got an extra dessert with ""happy anniversary"" written in chocolate. Such a lovely touch. The take home muffins really show that they go that extra step and they are delicious!"
5,1,"Treated like family! Many super friendly servers and managers ensured our every need was met... Julie, Jennifer and Camara all helped recommend a delicious and authentic assortment of very high quality bbq and Kim chi . I enthusiastically suggest you check this place out"
5,1,"I don't care if this gives me a heart attack, but I can tell you that this beats a diet coke and a salad any day so just suck it up, overlook the calorie signs, brave the tourist line, and indulge. You'll have the best burger of your life, and go all the way please. That means fries, a burger, and a milk shake (black and white is pretty awesome). Don't even think about calorie counting here if you want to enjoy your experience."
4,-1,"Food is delicious but the line is too long.. need to hire more people, but still everybody is very nice and they do their best to serve you fast.. I tried the Masala Dosa and it was AMAZING!"
4,1,"Love this place. Its the perfect little place to come for lunch and also dinner. The food is consistently good and comes out ultra fast. ??The only real complaint is that the service can sometimes be a little abrupt - but whatever this is NYC. ??Must haves - Lamb Sandwich, Butter Bean Salad, Saganaki and Mezze Plate."
5,-1,"This place is pretty close to perfect. ??Amazing brick oven, wood fired pizza, incredible heros made with homemade, amazing dough. ??Sauce is fresh, barely touched using great products. ??Incredibly warm and nice staff both in person and on the phone. ??This isn't a complaint but a request.... I wish they had a few more appetizer choices, i think they could do a really good fried mozzarella app, fried calamari, maybe an arancine? I also wish they would make a clam pizza which when done well by great pizza restaurants is absolutely amazing. ?? I just feel like they would do everything well and this would be great. ??Keep it up Peppinos, you guys are great in every way."
4,1,Best brunch spot around. Be prepared to wait if you go on peak hangover recovery time as the place gets super crowded. Once you get in you will see why they love it. Go here it's worth it.
4,1,"I was a bit skeptical about the high Yelp rating but I finally got out here and I was really impressed! I had the masala dosa, spicy, which he serves with sambar soup and coconut chutney, for only $5. He has to slice up the dosa to get it to fit in the takeaway container so you don't get to see the impressive gigantic rolled up dosa like at some restaurants, however, he lets you look at it while it's cooking. The dosa skin, sambar, and chutney were just as good as any dosa I've had in a sit-down restaurant. The masala filling itself was maybe not as spicy or flavorful as it could be, but still good, especially considering it comes from a street cart. Can't wait to get back out here and try some of his other dosa offerings."
4,1,"good pizza, salad, and wine, what more do you want?"
3,-1,This is a bar where bartenders chest bump while making a cosmo. That says a lot. But the owners are great and the food is too....despite the tom cruisiness of the chest bump
4,-1,"This was my second visit to Ponty (named for a main drag in Dakaar). My younger brother suggested it on boyz nite out. Needless to say I was doubtful. Happily I was wrong. I had a deliciouslamb shank w/couscous and merguez. My bro had the hangar steak,which was tender,delicious, and cooked as he liked it (medium is too done for me). I took my wife there on Sun. afternoon for a late lunch and got the prix ??fixe. Appy,main, & dessert for $19.99 was a great deal. Mussels were super and filet stuffed w/ REAL crab was moist and scrumptious. Hangar steak was again terrific.This place is a must try"
5,1,"I think I saw someone say it here before but the pancake hype is REAL! ??Sure the line is crazy long but do your research and sign up early! ??We got there a little before 9am on a Sunday and there was already a line, not to be seated mind you but a line to get on the waiting list since the place hasn't opened it. ??Like everyone says, they have this app where they put your name and number down that sends you a text when your table is ready. ??We were a party of 2 and had a wait time of 45-60 min. ??We got the text literally at the 44th min mark. ?? I ordered their special Huckleberry pancakes. ??Oh em gee. ??Best pancakes EVAR and yes the maple syrup is out of this world. ??And this is coming from someone that HATES maple syrup. ?? My buddy had biscuits and sausage which were both great. ??They have this homemade raspberry jam which was also delicious Is the wait worth it? ??Well I didn't wait that long but I did do my research and took people's advice to get there early. ??Would I wait over 2 hour..ehh depends how hungry I am at that point, but yes I would say it is definitely worth it!"
5,-1,"I have been to Jacob's Pickles upwards of 10 times for both Brunch and Dinner. ??The restaurant is incredibly cozy and trendy with lots of exposed brick and white-washed wood. ??It is a very cool atmosphere with a mixture of small tables and large communal ones. Dinner is absolutely delicious. I almost always get the Chicken, Bacon, Egg, and Cheese biscuit sandwich, but their other entrees are great, too, especially the fish tacos! Beware, the serving sizes are quite large. ??The cocktails are very good here and the beer selection is great. Brunch is equally incredible. ??It appears that the breakfast sandwiches and the chicken and pancakes are very popular. ??The BLT Bloody Mary is very popular, but my friend said it was a little too horseradish-y. ?? I have only ever had their pickles once, and they are GREAT! ??Again, the serving sizes are huge and you will likely receive too many pickles. ??DO NOT get more than one variety if you are in ??party of two people. Order a couple varieties only if you are with at least 3 or 4 people. As other reviewers have mentioned, the owner is very friendly and often very present in the restaurant. ??It's true that the restaurant will text you when your table is ready for brunch, which is super convenient. ??Expect to wait 45-60 minutes for weekend brunch."
4,-1,"Came here with ??large group and they were able to accommodate us! I ordered the salmon with mushroom risotto which was awesome. Reasonably priced for NYC except the wine. I don't really understand how a beer could be $7 a mixed drink is $12 and a glass of wine comes out to $15! However, everyone enjoyed their meal and location and atmosphere were both very nice! Would definitely recommend."
4,-1,Woorjip is a cute little spot to grab something to eat there or on the go. I've tried some of the sushi rolls and I believe a noodle or something. Been here a couple times and it's a casual environment for a quick meal.
3,1,"WARNING: Adrienne's Pizza Bar is located in downtown tourist central, nearish to the South Street Seaport! If you insist on visiting, you do so at your peril in the high season, in the evening, and on weekends! Though the number of noteworthy eateries in the FiDi approaches zero, Adrienne's Pizza Bar earned my attention when it was listed at number 14 in New York Magazine's last top 20 pizzas in New York issue. Or was it Time Out? Whatever. The name ""pizza bar"" pretty much accurately captures the essence of Adrienne's. The narrow restaurant has a long bar running along one side and a long row of too-close-for-comfort tables running along the other, presumably to pack in as many loud-mouth tourist and/or FiDi douchebags as possible. No douchey or touristy scrum was present when I went at the odd time of four in the afternoon to try their fare. Despite the lack of patrons, the woman who seated me was sort of rude in a blase, ""your bill is obviously not going to be high so why are you wasting our time"" sort of way. Oddly, when I ordered the Old Fashioned Pizza (fresh mozzarella and crushed tomatoes), she warned me that it's really big. Then she asked if that's all I wanted! A little weird! The bartender who eventually showed up was much nicer, so I'm sure the service is normally just peachy. So, for $17 or so, you have your choice of two or three types of pizza which all sounded similar to me, so there isn't much selection. You can, for $3 each, add toppings, but $17 seemed quite enough for pizza to me. Indeed, it is huge: they slide this huge cookie pan covered in square pizza slices over to you when it's ready, so you can't say you're not getting your money's worth, at least. I'm not usually a fan of square pizza, but this one was incontestably adequate. In fact, it is exactly the sort of pizza you might like to eat at a bar while drinking beer or wine: no particularly distinctive flavors but an extremely satisfying bite after bite of crispy crust, cheese, and fresh tomatoes. Great as comfort food, because you can keep eating and not really have to pay attention to it. You know it's not like other gourmet places, too, because they offer the usual shakers of oregano, hot pepper flakes, and parmesan cheese crumblings. I wouldn't call this a destination pizzeria, but if you're in the area for some bizarre reason, I can't think of anywhere else to go. The size of the pizza is probably enough for two, though I ate most of mine by myself, and I'm sure other big eaters could finish off the whole thing easily. I did not sample the other items on the sparse menu, but regular Italian dishes and a few salads are available. I did have a really good and really big coffee to excrementalize my meal for only $2."
5,-1,"After reading all the great reviews on here bout this place I visited NY with a friend. The cheapest Chinese food place ever, anywhere. Everything is good, ask for extra sauce, be picky, and all your request will be granted. we ordered for roast pork or chicken on small rice with a vegetable or noodle ??Amazing the roast pork was cut into thin strips so it made it easy to just devour in 1 bite. Delicious we really enjoyed lunch. After you get your food, walk across to the park and you'll find picnic tables and seats. Watch the kids, the old people, and the weirdos, and take a moment to feel how blessed you are. we Highly recommended this place and come back soon"
5,-1,"Wow! My partner and I just loved everything about this new restaurant - the ambience, service and - you guessed it, the food. The carrot ginger soup with toasted chili marshmallow is a knock-out and my husband couldn't get enough of the miso-glazed bone marrow. We shared the rib-eye (he's a red meat man) which was perfectly cooked, juicy and flavoursome. I didn't have room for dessert, but being the old-fashioned guy he is, he couldn't resist the apple-raisin crumble with vanilla ice cream. ??Fantastic. ??We'll be back soon."
1,1,"I've been to many many many restaurants far and wide in this city and this tops the WORST MEAL EVER list. Went to Frankie's last Saturday and was told the wait was going to be 20 minutes. It turned out to be an hour. Oh well, no big deal. I ordered the gnocchi ??which was detestable. It tasted like someone dumped ??a jar of tomato sauce found on the shelf at food 4 less onto half a serving of over boiled gnocchi. Gross. You would fare 5x's ??better for a quarter of the cost to stay home and have gnocchi's from Trader Joes. seriously. I am noticing people are giving good reviews and am surprised. The general consensus for dinner on all 4 dishes ordered by 4 different people was disappointing and subpar. I can not believe people are giving this place a good review. Either this place is wildly inconsistent from day to day, or you people have really poor taste. Anyway, food is not the only issue here. The waiters are on a trip. When a friend had asked for bread (he had eggplant parm) the waiter came back and SLAMMED the mini bread plate on top of the olive oil ! dish and rushed off. wtf"
4,-1,"We had to book gramercy Tavern a month in advance to get a reservation and apparently it is always fully booked. Everything that needs to be said has already been said by previous reviewers and there is no doubt that this is a great place to eat. I do think that it is far too expensive and whilst we had a great meal, it isn't 'special'. If you want really good food in a lovely setting then it's worth a try, but I wouldn't return. I also ate at their sister restaurant (Union Sq Cafe), which I actually thought was much better value."
5,-1,"Best restaurant experience of my life. The service was a cut above other elite NYC restaurants, and each course was beautifully presented and perfectly prepared. The wine pairing was also well-executed. A most-welcome surprise was the opportunity to tour the kitchen at the end of the meal, receive a small tutorial in molecular gastronomy, ??Afterward we were seated at a small table in a private area of the restaurant where we received a complimentary bottle of cognac and various smaller desserts. Worth every penny. And am very excited to go again."
5,1,"We had our wedding reception here and I couldn't have been happier. ??Not only was the food amazing but the service was spot on. ??The food highlights were the stuffed mushrooms, the penne ala vodka, and the lemon chicken. ??To this day when we see people who were at the wedding we still talk about how good the food was. ??At first I was concerned about the cost per person for a reception but after having experienced the food and service I feel like it was worth every penny. Tip: they server everything family-style so the prices look high but one dish can serve many people. ??Make sure the people you go with can agree on sometime together."
4,1,"I love the food here, but it is not an intimate place, it's so loud and busy u might get panic attack here its that crowded, but food is really good."
4,1,"Do you like fried food? Small enough that you can hold, but big enough to fill you up? Get your empanadas here. So, my friends and I got almost one of each empanas on the menu. I wasn't a fan of their corn or organic ones. They are significantly smaller. One of my friends didn't mind the corn, but we did all agree that the organic ones weren't very good. They are whole wheat, small in size and very grainy. If you feel guilty about eating fried food, I guess you can purchase the organic ones instead. Spinach & cheese- it tastes like Greek spinach pie. Flaky outside shell. Delicious. Turkey, turkey cheese- very good. Only regret is that I wish it had more cheese. They are stuffed with meat though. Pesto, mozzarella, tomato- what could go wrong? Delicious gooey hot cheese with refreshing tomato with pesto sauce. Yum Ground beef- not as flavorful as I thought it would. Slightly disappointed. Egg, cheese, bacon, ham- it's a breakfast wrap in empanada form, so it's better! because it's deep fried! whoohoo! ground chicken- like any other ground chicken empanada. nutella chocolate and banana- so, I have mixed feeling about this one. Mine was mostly banana. It wasn't bad, but I longed for nutella. However, my friend's dessert empanada was oozing with nutella with pieces of banana. I envied hers, but was too full to steal it. I was sad that it wasn't consistent. Overall, they are made to order, so you get them fresh, hot and flaky. However, consistency is a little off on the empanadas. Also, if you are worried that you won't be able to tell them apart, they put them in individual bags that have labels on them. Also, the regular flour empanadas had words imprinted along the edges. Cute shop, cash only and definitely delicious and cheap for me to come back."
4,-1,"What a great restaurant. ??My wife and I had a delightful meal here. ??The food was very good and our waitress was very pleasant and helpful. ?? This location is a little bit of a walk from either Court Street or Smith Street but if you are regularly in the neighborhood for dinner or drinks, I would encourage you to try Bar Bruno."
4,1,"checked in at room service on my walk home, we spotted a lovely table outside and decided it would be a waste if we didn't sit down for 1 drink. We took a glance at their (affordable) wine list and went with the pinot grigio. I wish I remembered the name because I really liked the fish sitting on the beach chair. We also proceeded to order the Asian Fritters, a combo platter of fried tofu, dumplings and spring rolls. Yum. Was the perfecting ending to a perfect evening."
5,-1,"this is where sushi and gastro meet! the quality of the fish is spectacular! but on top of that you will try it with experimental spices, herbs, sauce like nowhere else! other than the fish, the pork belly is very tasteful and the fried chicken is the only one I can eat!"
5,-1,"This is as close to authentic Italian food and ambiance as it gets outside of Italy. ??It is an intimate and charming restaurant but the real wow is the food. ??Don't let the fact that it is all 100% gluten free scare you, although it is perfect for those who need to avoid gluten. ??Everything is delicious. ??We started with the fresh pear and avocado salad and then had a funghi (mushroom) risotto and a carciofi (artichoke) risotto. ??Both were creamy and so full of flavor and delicious taste. Then we topped it off with a cool and chocolatey sweet tiramisu. ??We've been back twice since then to try other risottos and each one is better than the last. ??A definite destination restaurant in the east village. ??Enjoy!"
4,-1,Great fries and sauce. ??A definite if your into the underground illegal fried potato scene.
3,1,"I'm really torn on this place. I want to love such an eclectic destination. I had reservations for my birthday and we had to wait quite a while before we were seated. The restaurant was also HOT. As in, the temperature. Back in March. I love German food but I think this is the first Austrian place I've been to. I admit I had high expectations, and it didn't meet them. The spaetzle was only OK. The schnitzel was average. Unanimously, the best dish by far was the flatbread. Edi and the Wolf is a unique spot off the beaten path, but hard to justify the $$$."
5,-1,My friends told me to try this place if I was ever close by. ??I am glad I did. ??It was everything I was told it would be. The food is great. You can't go wrong.
5,-1,I went there for the first time this past weekend and LOVED it!!! ??I had never had Thai food before and I thought it was fantastic and the bartender was a character. ??Prices were amazing and our apps AND dinner came out in record time!!! Next time I go to Brooklyn I'll definitely go back!!!!
1,-1,bad bad bad.. looks like a canteen that serves pasta to people who never tasted pastas in their lives . Service was somewhat decent but the quality of the food was mediocre at best. I really not understand they hype about this place. I live in the hood and i always avoid restaurant in restaurant row because i know they are tourist traps ..well that's a good example. Yelp stirred me wrong ??on that one as it was expensive for what it is . Avoid at all costs
2,1,"Came here for dinner. The place looked very nice, played great music, and the service was excellent--our waitress was really friendly and helpful. But when it came to the actual main plates, no one in my party of five much liked our food. ??I got a steak au poivre--it got plus points for being grass-fed meat, but the sauce was just so-so (though the frites the dish came with were perfect). ??Some friends got the rack of lamb, and they said it came was too salty and that they'd had better. ??The desserts were good and some of the sides and appetizers were also good, but overall, all of us were a little disappointed. Lastly, this place is very loud. ??It doesn't have ambiance, it has AMBIANCE. So, summary: nice looking place with excellent service, but pretty loud and with mediocre-to-okay main plates."
4,1,"Quality food, adequate service (could be more attentive, but it wasn't awful by any means), adequate prices. Family of 5 including a 4-year old on a non-reservation on Friday evening. Seated immediately, got a bread plate, and a plastic water cup with a lid on it for the child without even asking (smart move, Miriam's). There were three other small kids at the place, so clearly it's a family friendly place, despite having a bar. We split a bunch of small (really small) sample plates of za'atar, beets, cauliflower and eggplant, calamari, shrimp and zucchini. All of them were good - I would say the shrimp was the best. Entrees ordered were couscous w/grilled bronzino, Levantine bronzino and chicken shawarma. Again, all were very good."
5,-1,We went to that restaurant yesterday and we had an amazing time! The service and food were both wonderful and we appreciated the corner table for the two of us as it was very romantic and cozy. The artichoke appetizer was outstanding as was the Porcette. Our waiter informed us it takes time to prepare and the dish was totally worth the wait. Also enjoyed the special cocktail for desert which was like drinking a chocolate covered cherry. We will definitely go back.
3,1,"I go there only for lunch. They have a lunch box special. I love it!! Portion and price are just right! Bunch of tapas in the box and soda with it. Tapas in the lunch box are amazing. Tempura are crispy! Reminds me of my favorite restaurant in Japan. However, when it comes to their main food Soba, I don't know if I can say ""I love it"". Soda is really fresh because they make it in the house but the broth is not right. Something is just not right.... Salty but missing something.... Over all I love this place. My favorite: - Lunch box Reason of 3 stars - The broth for Soba is not good. Soba is their main food so I expect better."
3,-1,"Food was absolutely INCREDIBLE. So good, so filling, we were so happy with it. However, we went on Monday night. The place was full, but service was extremely slow. They seemed very understaffed and stressed, which reflected back into our own feelings. We waited over 20 minutes for our drinks (Voodoo Bloody Mary's are SO GOOD though), and we didnt get our food until over an hour after being seated. And we were super hungry. Overall, it was delicious and we'll be back for the food, but the service was incredibly frustrating and the experience would be so much better with a fuller staff."
5,1,377 reviews? there is literally nothing original for me to say. nothing.
5,-1,"This is my second visit and the sushi and sashimi are just incredible! The only negative point is that they make it complicated to book a table. You have to call, get a reservation number, then call again... a bit irritating. Still the best sushi place ever. Watch out... They do not accept TIPS!!!"
5,-1,"I dont care what people have to say, this is the place to get your early morning grub. Get off the plane at JFK, catch a cab and head right over to Clinton Bakery. So what if you have to wait, this place is worth it!! The biscuit sandwich is just plain awesome."
4,1,"Great food at a GREAT price. ??Joya is a go-to for free/very fast delivery and cheap eats. ??When the weather is nice they have a great patio (with unfortunately small tables). ??While there is often a wait for tables of four or more it is definitely worth it. ??However, the inside can be loud with music and the kitchen. ??I really like this place -- just wish the music was a little bit softer."
3,1,I went about 2 weeks ago. I had the lamb. It wasn't lamb chops. It wasn't that succulent. The food in fact wasn't that good but the ambiance and service are amazing. So glad to have finally experienced it. reservations fill up fast so def book in advance. Feels like Paris in there!
5,-1,"My friends and I were involved in a meeting nearby and saw Brooklyn Crab as we passed. ??After our meeting the five of us decided to go there to eat. ??We were met with a wonderful, friendly staff. ??The food was good and the drinks too. ??We went back two weeks later and met with the same response. ??I had had the delicious crab cakes the first time, but decided to join my friends and have the shrimp basket. ??WOW, the shrimps were amazing --- large and tended , fried, but not overly done. ??I would recommend this place in a heart beat. ??It was a nice evening and the windows were up, giving us a wonderful view of the Manhattan Skyline."
4,1,Delicious!! like literally everything was delicious ... may come back tomorrow! One star off for only accepting cash.
4,-1,"Love the food, always fresh!!!! And the space is so warm and cozy, plus a friendly staff!!!"
4,-1,"I love greek/mediterranean food but i have to say that this place is alright. ??It definitely does not deserve 4 or 5 stars. Our food took forever to come out. ??Getting the bill was like asking for gold. That took 15 minutes in itself. ??It really shouldn't be that hard. ??I know they're busy but still. ?? The food was good but not great. ??Their portions were great, definitely enough to fulfill an hungry person. ??I'll have to have some of their seafood next time and see what I think about them."
4,-1,Very good bar in Williamsburgh. ??Stumbled upon it and I am now a fan.
5,1,"Excellent food and reasonably priced drinks of a decent selection. It gets loud in the evening, but overall a fun night out. Highly recommend splitting a bunch of the small plates--they're delicious."
5,1,"Great cocktails in the downstairs lounge. Vince is an expert. It's alot of fun sitting by the bar and watching him meticulously make superb cocktails. The drinks with egg whites are fantastic, especially the empire of the sun. ??Try them all. ??I also love the chilled glasses and large single ice cubes. ??A true sign of caring about the craft. I also loved the sherry drink with mint served in a cocktail shaker. ??The salt and ash drink actually tasted like salt and pepper with a nice aroma of orange. I also dig the chill atmosphere. I never felt rushed sitting at the bar and there was plenty of space at the tables and seats in the room. ??The dj was great mixing up everything from Motown to 80s rock to new indie music ??to disco. Something for everyone."
4,1,I really like the atmosphere of this place. ??The food is very good as well and not super pricey!
3,-1,"My friend and I decided to come here on a Saturday night, and we probably should've thought that through a bit - we had to wait for over an hour but oh, well, at least the sprawling garden area is a nice place to wait, and the staff was considerate. Once we were seated, we were told that there would be an additional wait if we ordered pizza, but we opted for pizza anyway. So, after about 90 minutes, we finally got our pizza and, how was it? Well, it was pretty good: the pizza with cheese, honey and black pepper was tasty but not mindblowing; the (more-expensive) pizza with tomato, capers and tuna was OK, but dull - the tuna was touted as 'Sicilian tuna belly,' but it tasted like plain old tuna to me. For desert, we tried the olive oil gelato: delicious, but priced prohibitively at $7 a serving. In other words: Roberta's was pleasant, but now that I know a bit about the hit-or-miss quality of the food, the somewhat high prices and the long waits, I doubt I'll be coming back."
4,-1,Don't dismiss this place just because it's inexpensive. The food is good! Came here with friends and their child about 11pm and had a very nice meal.
5,1,"It took us a while to find NY Dosas but it was well worth the time. Thiru the Dosa Man makes the dosa fresh after you order and the Pondicherry is the most popular filled with potatoes and a handful of salad. Mint chutney and coconut chutney are given as dips or you can also use the sambar -- traditional vegetable stew as well. Everything is so fresh and tasty for about $6. The portions are huge so one order is more than enough for a hearty appetite or will work for two smaller appetites to share. If you're a visitor, I highly suggest going on the search for Thiru. He is at Washington Square on the corner of Sullivan and Washington Square.... until 4pm."
1,-1,"Awful!!! Occasionally you might have an ok special - and never see it again on the menu. ??Regular menu is very ordinary, nothing special. ??Wine and beer are ok, several different beers but the beer is way over priced!!! Like Manhattan prices. ??They even charge you for olives!!! Terrible. ??Dark and depressing atmosphere inside. ??The servers/bartenders should ??take 'smile classes' . ??Wouldn't recommend this place at all. ??How they stay in business is beyond me. I HAD to click on a star to POST this review, otherwise they don't deserve any stars, that's for sure!"
5,1,"My wife, Irene and I joined my daughter, Kim and son-in-law Jason for dinner out last Saturday Night at XiXa (prounced Shiksa and if your Jewish, you know what it means!). ??Well I have to tell you, the place is very eclectic and funky, from my point of view, with subdued lighting and tight knit rows of connected boat rope hanging from the ceiling, most unusual! ??The crowd was young and we seemed like the oldest couple there! ??Now this is a Mexican Restaurant, but I believe a Fusion style restaurant, blending in Asian touches of culinary treats. ??So we looked at the menu and ordered 12 dishes!!! ??Yes, 12! ??I came to understand earlier that this was a tapas type venue (small portions), so I assumed that I would be hungry when done. ??We started with an amazing bottle of fruity and crisp wine and we could have easily had a 2nd one, except for the fact we had to drive back to Bayside and Great Neck. ??Our dishes started to come, one at a time and they were made up of chicken, shrimp and Mexican and Asian Fusion style cooking. ??We started to taste this food and our taste buds began to say WOW!!!!! ??Tastes that my ""buds"" had never experienced! ??We were served one dish after another and were floored as to the stupendous and varied flavors that we experienced. ??Although I cannot remember the names of any dishes, I can rest assure you that whatever you order will be an amazing and one of a kind tasting event. ??This is a must go to hot spot, which has only been open a few months and they own another restaurant a hop, skip and a jump away, called Traip (229 S. 4th st between Driggs & Roebling St 347-844-9578,traifny.com), which we will surely try in the near future, maybe this weekend! ??All I can say, is if you to have a food experience and an out of body experience, go to Xisa. ??Yes, I was still hungry when we left, but it was worth every penny!!!"
2,1,"This review is for the reservation process at the restaurant, not for the food or atmosphere. Planned a weekend the city for my wife's birthday. I emailed the restaurant 15 days ahead of our reservation request and got a reply to with telling me reservations are taking two weeks ahead of time. So I called the next day and made a reservation for a Saturday at 8 o'clock four people. ??Despite making the reservation two weeks ahead of time I was greeted three days prior to our arrival with a phone call saying that there was a mixup with the reservations and that they could no longer honor our reservation time and at the restaurant was completely booked for Saturday. ??Having worked in the restaurant industry for a number of years, this seems very suspicious to me, particularly because it took so long for them to contact me with this mistake. They did offer to make alternate reservations at another restaurant, but couldn't necessarily say at that time what the restaurant would be. Ultimately they did make us a reservation for the night before, but that doesn't work with our plans so we will not be dining at Hudson Clearwater. I am sure the restaurant is amazing and the food is very good. However, any long-lasting restaurant understands the importance of every step in the process. Having a failed reservation for an out of town guest on a Saturday night is a systematic failure and will ultimately corrode the restaurants ability to provide a quality dining experience in the future."
1,-1,"The sushi was not fresh and the meat was not good. ??The chef was very rude and made me feel unwelcome. ??For the amount of money you spend, you will be disappointed. I recommend you read all the reviews on Yelp, especially the filtered ones. Also, do online research of chef Cesar Ramirez. ??The Guardian has a lengthy article describing racism by Cesar. Yelp has repeatedly deleted all of the 1 star ratings on this restaurant, including mine. ??I guess Cesar paid one of those ""advertising fees"" to create an inflated rating."
4,-1,My Fav Thai Restaurant. Even the Wine menu works for me!!
4,1,"Went for dinner and were seated promptly. Started off with a squash blossom appetizer that was fried, filled with cheese, and crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. It was tasty but a little greasy. Next had the fried seafood plate and each piece was crisp, light, and fresh. Overall the seafood was great, and the fish was fried perfectly but a little too salty. The fried parsley a nice touch. For the pasta course we got the fetuccine special which was light and filled with shrimp & clams. There was no grit to the clams and it was a nice course to have in-between the appetizers and the main course. The special is the suckling pig for $70 which is more than enough fo 2 people. 3-4 people could have eaten it. ??The skin was crunchy although very salty, and the pork tender. It was a fantastic entree. For dessert we had a variety of sorbets and gelato, along with a shaved ice covered with espresso. They were all pretty good. The wait staff was attentive but the evening that we went, the air conditioning was not working properly and if I had been in a jacket it would have been too hot. The decor is bright, with an open area for you to see the preparation of some of the appetizers. All in all a nice place to eat, what you would expect from a Danny Meyer restaurant."
4,-1,Speedy Service ++. Very warm welcome from entire staff. Very warm good bye from entire staff. Pork buns were delectable. Spicy Ramen was great.
5,-1,this is the place to go in Tribeca. I love their knowledgeable friendly staff; they make great suggestions and allow you to taste the wine before choosing. They had a large selection.
5,1,I'm not a huge fan of pisco sours but the bartenders know how to make an awesome one. ??The staff here is great - they are so sweet & attentive. ??I've been here for drinks & boozy brunch. ??Both times we never noticed when our glasses were empty. ??The food was great. ?? I'm definitely going back
3,1,"I know, I know, only three stars? Well in fact, I actually considered going with two for a while. And it's not because the food isn't good and the service isn't fantastic. And I didn't have a bad experience. So hear me out! Scarpetta provides really excellent food in a wonderful atmosphere with cordial, friendly and knowledgeable wait staff. Yet despite all this, I am not a fan, because I have in fact, had better. Their stromboli bread to start is, as others have said, quite delicious. Have a couple of those rolls. Also, take the recommendation of other yelpers and get the braised short ribs as an appetizer. Or the polenta. Both are winners. They really are quite good. As far as an entree goes, you won't leave disappointed with any of them. The reason I feel disappointed by this is that rather than letting the ingredients speak for themselves, the style here is more ""gourmey chef-y"", where complexity and distraction are added in an attempt to produce something fantastic. This is true even for the simple spaghetti with basil. It's not to say it was poorly executed - things were done quite well - it's just that these dishes can be done so much better when the ingredients are allowed to speak for themselves. Take the spaghetti for example. Some here have raved about how the fresh pasta is perfectly cooked, toothsome, and has a velvety smooth sauce. Now - these things are all true, but I would argue that cooking pasta perfectly al dente is actually not that impressive of a feat (maybe you've just gone to the wrong places?), and point out that the ""velvety"" nature of the sauce is the result of a nice simple marina sauce infused with a healthy dose of butter and a touch of cream. It's not bad. It's not greasy. it's just that when you let it speak for itself, when you make a perfect marinara sauce and use nice fresh basil, you don't have to resort to those tricks of the trade. I was disappointed that after hearing all this stuff about this miraculous tomato basil sauce, what it all comes down to is tricking your brain into loving it by adding a bit of fat. All this aside, if your goal is to try out all the great places NYC has to offer, you should probably check this place out. But if you're looking for a special night out that will happen more infrequently, I'd recommend passing on Scarpetta in favor of Babbo or Esca."
5,-1,Best food ever! Will definitely go back!
1,1,"After waiting an hour on a wednesday night for a table I was not impressed. The food is nothing special I ended up ordering a salad with warm mozzarella. It was good but nothing great. I could have made it myself at home for 1/5 of the price. My boyfriend had a burger which he said was good, I did taste his fries and they were good. Overall, I would not return here. The wait was too long and the food was not special or worth the time spent waiting. They did score some points for having a friendly staff- but I guess you should expect that with the price you pay for your meal."
1,-1,Wish ??I could give this restaurant 0 stars. ??The service provided by that nasty little Mexican Freddy is awful. ??Won't be going back!
4,1,"I believe the Umami Burger menu ranges from 'just good' to 'amazing', with the items people most commonly order (truffle fries, truffle burger, classic umami burger) being 'just good'. ??While expensive for a burger, I believe the best parts of the menu are creative, unique, and delicious enough to be considered good value. With the more commonly ordered burgers, most people will agree that they are executed quite well, but given all the hype that Umami Burger has, it takes a bit more to blow people away. With the truffle fries, I get that having such small fries means a high surface area to volume, making them a crunchier experience than most other regular fries, but they're almost infuriatingly small. ??Expect to get about 1 order for every 1-2 people in your group. The real successes on the menu in my opinion are some of the less ordered burgers, particularly the duck burger, which used to be on their ""secret menu"". ??The burger patty has tons of flavor and is topped with a nicely complementary chutney, with some indulgent fried fatty duck skin bits as a crispy garnish. ??My friend claimed the Royale with braised short rib was even better, but I foolishly didn't try any...yet."
2,-1,"Came here for lunch and the entrance it was very welcoming. I was disappointed that they didn't have as much of a variety on the lunch menu. The portion size is HUGE! You definitely need to go there with an entire group. The food was just ok, not great not bad. Our server was attentive but brought me wine in a juice glass. Found that very strange. For a well known restaurant how could he not know which glass is for what. I'm not sure if I would go there again, it's not at the top of places I would revisit."
2,1,"Pros: Chocolate pudding cake Key lime pie Mac and cheese Cons: Waited 45 minutes on line to hear that they were SOLD OUT of beef ribs, beans, collard greens and root beer. Couldn't you put up a sign and inform your customers??? Nope. You just had us all wait till we got to the front of the line to let us know. No bueno! Brisket was mediocre. Needed some salt. Spare ribs were so dry I couldn't cut it with a knife nor my teeth. Potato salad was okay. There was nothing outstanding. You don't have to waste a trip down to Red Hook to wait at least 45 minutes on line for mediocre food."
3,-1,I really loved the sushi. I wasn't sure how to order first because they don't have a set omakase meal like many restaurants. It's by how much you want to eat. Good thing is you can tell them your budget. ??For appetizers we had the clam soup. It was good and fresh.I believe the dish was meant to be simple. Reason for 3 stars is very pricey place.
4,-1,"The wait is so long here regardless of time of day or how many party you have. The Pork Bun is the ultimate best thing on the menu. Ramen is decent, but like other yelpers, there are better ones out there. But I would still return for the pork buns! O, and service is always good here even though they're always busy.."
4,1,"Really great spot. Loved the open space, loved the fact that they have wifi and are cool with people working there for extended periods of time. And the food is wonderful! My only disappointment? I had scoped the website and wanted to try the Saucisson - a ""Dry cured fennel and sage saucisson of sundried tomato, porcini mushroom and sunflower seed on whole grain sourdough toast with aioli, and pickled radishes."" But the item is no longer on the menu and they need to revamp the site. So I went with the oyster mushroom and chick pea ""nuggets"" with mustard instead, which were a good, hearty choice. So then I really REALLY wanted to do a half and half on the MOB, which wasn't possible. I was bummed since I don't live in the area, but powered through it ;) I ended up with the Bright Eyes, which was a good choice, but I found myself looking around at everyone else's meal longingly too. Yeah, I'm a fat kid. Don't judge. Here's the description of Bright Eyes from the menu: ""House made cashew yogurt, peperonata,a sweet and lightly acidic (from white wine vinegar) stew of sweet peppers and onions. Next the mob is topped with fresh seasonal fava beans and crimini mushrooms roasted in garlic. The final garnish on this mob is a touch of spicy and fresh tasting watercress."""
2,1,"i'm not sure what all the fuss is about. The menu was very boring and the food wasn't worth the 45 minute wait. The only redeeming factors about this place are the fried green tomatoes and the fact that is a 10 min walk from my apt. i had the spanish scramble, which was just ""eh"". my friend's southern breakfast was tiny and wasn't impressive... however, i have to admit, i did not try the pancakes. perhaps if i happen to walk by and there's no wait, i might give this place another shot. service was subpar. after our mediocre meal, we were waiting for our friend to finish up in the bathroom, when we were asked to leave after lunch because there was a 1 hr wait. ??besides the fact that we waited 50 min for OUR table, we were only going to take another 5 min! meanwhile, the table next to us was there longer and too busy taking pics of their food. wth! and what's with all the tourists!? not impressed."
5,1,"I've been to Mayfield's twice and both times were stellar! The ambiance and the food did not disappoint. Service was perfectly in tune with my mood both times - need more direction and just enough attention. The restaurant made great decisions on their interior design and musical selections. I very much appreciate the hints of art deco and jamming to ""Luchini"" by Camp Lo over dessert. The first time I had dinner and I was seated in the back close to the kitchen. My friend and I decided to celebrate our new fortunes that night. We shared the kale salad and grilled octopus. Score! Kale salad was fresh, light and had the perfect texture and acidity. Octopus was cooked perfectly! Not chewy, well-seasoned and complemented by an unexpected combination of proteins. Unfortunately, they ran out of venison, so we opted for the Grilled Pork Chop -- another star dish...the pork / ribs were moist and tender, yes...lip-smacking hella yum. We definitely felt the Southern comfort with grit cakes and sauteed greens. Lastly, we had the chocolat pot de creme for dessert ... we were much too polite, next visit we'd get our own. The second time I also went for dinner, this time, I sat at the bar. I was in the mood for an entree that was hearty and under $20. I opted for the lamb ragout with pappardelle. The sauce was full of flavor, meaty with lamb and the pasta was cooked to perfection, gentle and firm enough you want to cradle it with your fork and eat it for two hours as long as it stayed warm. Unfortunately I did not have two hours to spare, but in the brief time I was there, my ears were graced with Motown. Love the food, people, food, decor, food and music. Compliments to the kitchen!"
4,-1,"Becco is great!!! ??Osso Bucco, amazing. ??Lydia's marinara OMG!!!!!!! ??Becco is bustling pre-theatre, make sure you have reservations and be prepared for the crowd. ?? Otherwise go around 8pm when everyone is at the theatre!!!! ??It's like a different restaurant!!!! ??Love sitting at the bar for dinner too, the bartenders are great!!"
5,1,"This place is a great brunch spot for a few reasons. It has a peaceful vibe. It can be packed, but it doesn't get loud or chaotic. Assholes tend to like drama and this place just serves up a great burger. THE BURGER! That's the other reason you need to come here. Now, listen to your Aunt Lianne when she tells you that this place is known for their chop meat on a bun. My friend got the eggs benny and although she liked her dish, she spent the entire meal looking at my huge bacon and blue cheese burger ??complete with fries. Another reason to like this place is they have a private room in the back to accommodate larger parties which you need to reserve in advance. My friend Sara had her birthday brunch there last year and I was impressed with the menu selection and bottles of vodka and bloody mary mix put on our table. One more! They have multiple Foursquare deals: The Newbie, Loyalty etc. So if you check-in you can get $5 off your lunch bill or if you frequent the joint, you get half off a bottle of wine etc. In a city that's losing its charm each and every day with the addition of a new ""Ruby Tuesdays"" or ""TGI Friday's"" this place is a keeper. Keep it up, Janie!"
3,1,"I am SO sad to have to write this. I have been coming in quite regularly for the past few weeks and have been satisfied with the quality of the coffee, tea, baked goods, and sandwich specials. However, I recently ordered a gravalox sandwich that is on the menu (not a daily special) and it was very obviously made AT LEAST one day ago. The spread (cream cheese?) was dried out, the bread was stale, the salmon hanging over the edge of the sandwich was dried out, and the cucumbers were translucent. I found this very disappointing. I hope the owner ceases pre-making the sandwiches, because I'm sure other customers, like myself, would prefer to wait a few extra minutes for a fresh sandwich, than be unsatisfied with a $7 sandwich that is clearly old."
5,-1,I love this restaurant. ??Ate there last night (not my first time) and had the beer battered fried shrimp as well as the kale salad. ??Delicious! ??Def check out their burger as well as their brunch. ??The french toast is my fave.
3,1,"Went back for the carnitas, which were juicy and tender. ??But still stand by my initial review. ??Not a bad choice if near by, but won't seek it out if (sad to say) there is a Chipotle closer."
4,1,Awesome grilled cheese!!! ??Terrible Tomato Soup!!!
3,1,"3 stars in my world is average. ??Yes, this place is average. ??We showed up around 6:30pm...not going to a show, just checking out a local spot with great reviews. ??Really?! ??Great reviews for what? ??Not a special spot, service was not that good (hard to flag down your waiter as he had his back to us ??flirting with two women - the folks behind us sent a member of their party to hunt him down to get their check). ??Food was okay, the cocktails were good (worth the price), seating on rickety chairs in front of a wobbly table - not so good. ??The couple next to us was seated so close I thought our elbows were going to bang into each other. If you are in this neighborhood, go to Lillie's across the street."
4,-1,"The veal...the scallops..the halibut....all fantastic. ??Hard to go wrong with this place. ??Service was always fantastic. ??The waiters have good wine list knowledge and know how to pair with their dishes. If your a guy, then bring your girl. ??She will love it...and you for it...;)"
4,1,"Good,spot for quality and economy busy and very courteous"
4,1,"One of the more comfortable places in the city to stop by and get a drink. It's a fun atmosphere and the crowd is a nice mix of people with the jerk level seemingly on the low side. All the times I've been here with a large group, the waitress never had a trouble remembering all our drinks and various appetizers. Don't get the sausage rolls, but do get the dollar dogs. The wings are plentiful, but they aren't buffalo style. Great beer selection."
4,-1,the food is good and you get a very home feel. I always get the chicken swarma and the spinach pies.
5,1,"One thing Astoria is not short of is Greek restaurants. They are on almost every corner but MP Taverna stands out above them all. MP Taverna offers a complete unique twists on Greek classics and not only makes them modern, but it totally elevates them. Their food is fresh, colorful, and definitely delicious. This is a regular spot for me and when I go, I always get the mussels & gigantes to start which offers mussels in a phenomenal tomato broth with lovely bits of crispy sausage and feta cheese. Every bite is a whirlwind of different textures and flavors and the mussels taste like they just came from the ocean. I definitely recommend that as a starter to share. As an entree, the meat platter, the paella, and the roasted lemon chicken were on point. As I'm writing this my mouth is literally watering from thinking about the great food. Now I know that the famous Taverna Kyclades is not far away and I know that many people are loyal to the legendary spot, but to me MP Taverna offers a modern and unexpected experience. Skip the long lines at Taverna Kyclades and go to MP Taverna and you will not regret it."
5,-1,Amazing pizza!!
5,1,"Love this place. It's a good date-restaurant, nice atmosphere, although, once it fills up you feel kind of like you are on a double-date with the neighboring table. Definitely an awkward table-moving squeeze to get out. However, the food was fantastic - and the wait staff was really helpful in making decisions (she didn't even make fun of me when I couldn't pronounce the menu items). I also heard Tom Brady and Giselle have been spotted there and if it's good enough for Tom... I'm in."
1,1,"Wings: this is the reason I keep coming, but this time they were so salty I couldn't even finish them; still delicious, but waaaay to salty. Some customers beside us were saying exactly the same. Disappointing. Spare ribs: barely warm, and totally plain; there is NO way they cooked those express... felt like they were leftovers from lunch; the sauces they came with were uninspiring to say the least. We wanted to order more, but we stopped there. Last time we were disappointed by several dishes, and after seeing they f...ed up they best dishes, we were too afraid to order more. They are not exactly cheap, so we went elsewhere and finished dinner. After being a huge fan of this place, I had to hit the wall here twice, before realizing that it's not worth anymore. The only good thing left is the name. Unfortunately, I have no reason to ever go back."
2,-1,"Mediocre food, loud, expensive and bad service. Definitely a place to avoid if you don't appreciate the various intimate parts of pigs"
5,-1,"Bangin!!! The honey bbq wings and mac and cheese are to die for, and once I tried it other places in the neighborhood paled in comparison. This family owned restaurant will satisfy any craving for a homey slice of southern comfort. ??Also, dont miss out on the top notch cakes and pastries--More cheese biscuits please!"
1,-1,"A friend told me about this place. I decided to try it,I ordered a chicken box. I was told the chicken box was: 3 peices of chicken 1 biscuit 1 side I was blown away when I was given the total 14.00 I said wow this should be some damn good chicken NO !!!!! The chicken was cold The fries were TERRIBLE comparable to a bad batch at McDonald's but atleast at McDonald's the price makes it not hurt that bad. I decided never to return to this place until the friend encouraged me to call and tell them. I really felt I was given a box that was sitting out all day. Here is where it goes way downhill I was told they couldn't deliver it hot,I was asked what did I want them to do I said I don't know I just resigned myself to not coming back . I was told ok we will send you out another box and you can decide whether or not you want to return then apologies. I said ok, I was put on hold and then told they would not be able to send me the box they just promised me ...because I should have called yesterday. They said they were sorry I was upset. I said now I am more upset,then I was hung up on.I ended up speaking to the owner,who again promised me the free chicken box,but was very rude and condescending. I ended up telling her I didn't even want the chicken because if it was anything like what I ordered I would throw it away. Had to get it out pardon the delivery.....so many places with way better food better prices !!!! this place is wrong on so many levels on a bad day Popeyes is way better don't even talk about Harlem or different spots in bk stay in wburg you would never make it anywhere else....an honest review of the food I was served compounded by awful customer service no hope there it goes straight up to the owner ...started with terrible overpriced food...I was told by the owner when questioning the food for the price OH THOSE ARE JUST OUR PRICES I want to paint this picture to let you guys experience what I did do not support this place they do not deserve to be open point blank!!!"
5,-1,"Corner Bistro has become something of an institution. The old men behind the bar are no-nonsense, hard of hearing, and wonderful. The burgers are juicy and properly done to temperature and the fries are pitiful (overcooked, crunchy, not going to hit the spot). The beer list offers variety without going overboard. Everything is dirt cheap ($3 beer, $7 cheeseburger). It's a great spot to duck in for a burger and beer with friends, squished too close to your neighbors, while enjoying a simple yet delicious meal. Go early -- it gets packed fast."
4,-1,heard good reviews about this place from a friend and came to try it out. Lunch was good...but definitely not a fan of their beets. Head over to their cheesecake area right next door :D
3,-1,Nom nom nom.. Love love this place! Delicious fresh fries rock my world- and their sauce selection is a library of mayo based delight! ?? Sign me up.
5,-1,"Great food! Prompt and friendly service! An amazing hostess, who keeps her cool and can deal with the onslaught of people who show up for breakfast each day. And the biscuits! By Jove! The Biscuits!"
4,-1,"I love Yakitori and so does Anthony Bourdain. ??That makes me a food critic, right? ??Eh. ??Well I try. ?? The food: The place seems to specialize in Chicken - the logo makes that obvious. Had the chicken skewers - thigh, gizzards, liver, heart, skin (yes, really). All very different and delectable. Loved the liver and the gizzards too. Must try. Other skewers - Kobe beef, garlic. Skip the beef - too ordinary - instead, order more Chicken. The garlic is a good complement to other skewers. Yaki Don (sp) was a good way to fill up, where the flavors of the grilled chicken is soaked into the short grain rice. Solid dish. Service was typical Japanese - quick, polite, efficient. Definitely the best Tsukune I've had in the US. ??Give the Tontoro (pork neck) a try....."
4,1,Definitely 1 of the best in town. ??What's left to be said after about 5000 reviews. ??I will only say that the prices are a bit absurd for ramen. ?? I do admit tho that I do like being screamed at when I enter a restaurant. ??Makes ya feel really alive hahaha.
4,-1,"Been here many times and the Tapas do not disappoint. The staff ??are very knowledgeable so if ??you are ??not sure or if it's your first introduction ??to Spanish Tapas , just ask! ?? ??You can shop ?? and eat here , ?? so it's a convenient ?? place for all food stuff from Spain. ??A great place ."
5,1,"holy crap, this was amazing. the only other time I've had yakitori was in DC at Kushi, and the yakitori at totto is so far superior it's not even worth comparing. we tried a bunch of different kinds, but my two favorites were definitely the Kawa (chicken skin) and the chicken meatball. make sure to order several orders of each, trust me. just a tip, while you're waiting for a table (you will wait), head down one block to Three Monkeys Bar for a solid draft line-up can't wait to come back. wow."
1,-1,"Not a very good attempt at making this ""themed"" Cuban restaurant at all authentic. ??And found it interesting and unusual to see jazz being played live by hipsters on one evening....hmmm, weird. ??Sorry, just calling a spade a spade. ??They have it all wrong. ??Has potential though even when they bring your appetizers after dinner. ??And umm, well, I can go on and on about this. ??Fine for drinks but I wouldn't go beyond that if real Cuban food is what you're looking for. ??I go to CAFECITO in the East Village. ??If you want REAL Cuban food made by REAL Cubans and owned and operated by REAL Cubans, they have it all on the money there. ??I usually go there when I get the craving to eat Cuban food because it tastes how it's supposed to. ??With that said, buen provecho :) Signed: ??A REAL CUBAN"
3,1,"I wanted to have a better experience here, but unfortunately, a few things really brought our night down. 1. My boyfriend and I both love spicy food, so we asked for our shrimp and crawfish to be made ""spicy,"" which isn't even the highest level of spicyness they offer (it's still a step down from ""fire""). Yet our food was at a level of spicyness that almost made it inedible. It was so hard to enjoy because we were in serious pain the entire time. I actually felt my throat burning. We couldn't even eat any of the potatoes because they were so doused in the sauce of death. We tried our hardest to enjoy the food, but this seriously put a damper on the experience. 2. We got a shrimp/crawfish combination and I was disappointed to see that they only gave us one half cob of corn with it. I mean, come on, there are two of us... at least give us two pieces of corn. We had to share one sad half-cob. 3. We were told the wait would be 30 minutes and it ended up being almost an hour. 4. Our waitress didn't check on us until a good 15 or 20 minutes into the meal. If she had checked on us earlier, I would've told her how unbelievably spicy the food was, and maybe we could have gotten it re-made with a less spicy sauce, allowing us to enjoy our meals. But it was already getting late and we didn't have all night to sit and wait for her attention. Other than that, beneath the layer of deathly sauce, the shrimp and crawfish were very good. The shrimp were the plumpest I've ever had. And the whole experience is fun; the entire table is covered in paper, they put bibs on you, you get rubber gloves... it's just fun to have a super messy meal. Pretty cute place too. I might give it one more shot, but this time I'll be ordering everything ""mild"" or ""medium."" Being someone who puts crushed red pepper by the tablespoon in everything I eat, I thought I could handle my food ""spicy,"" but either they screwed up our meals, or their concept of spicy is on a whole other level."
5,1,Sooo yummy :) These hand pulled noodles are so chewy and the texture is just right. The dumplings are AMAZING. Must try when you visit. I also enjoyed the zha jiang mein
4,1,"I love this place. I went for the first time with friends and we all loved it. The ambiance is super chill, the food is tasty - and definitely affordable. The BYO situation is excellent. I had the Chasha Shamdey, spicy chicken curry in yogurt sauce - with a distinct cinnamon-y flavor - served with basmati rice. They will also add vegetables to your dish for less than $1. I also tried the Sha Momo, beef dumplings, which were tasty as well. I agree that the portions aren't huge, but my dish was more than enough for dinner. I will definitely come back."
5,1,"Favorite spot in NYC. Hands down best food, service, and decor. Nothing more needs to be said. If you have the money, go, NOW!"
5,1,"You spend 15 minutes trying to figure out where this place is located, only to discover that the restaurant is, in fact, that unmarked orange facade tucked into the street. The chefs scream ""????????¡X????????? (irasshaimase)!"" the second you walk in. Even when you pop in for lunch alone at the bar, you don't really feel all that lonely. And then it happens - the mera mera dip comes out. Maybe you've added chicken meatballs. Maybe not - doesn't really need them, although they're a decadent touch. You tuck in. Is it sprinkled with crack? Probably. Is that why you've eaten here 3 times this week? Most likely. Is it normal that you start craving the mera mera dip the second you leave the restaurant? Yes. But at less than $12 a pop do you care? Not at all. Bring on that sweet, sweet crack, my friends."
5,-1,"Juicy, juicy steak sandwiches. How do they cram so much juice in, I do not know. It's certain this place is full of people on a Saturday evening for a reason and it's the food. The ambience can be looked over because of how good the meat is here. Expect a line."
4,1,YUMMY brunch in my tummy! Huge fan of brunch and really enjoy a good eggs benedict. ??Quiant was super busy but accommodated us at a back table. ??The eggs benedict was cooked perfectly with a side of crispy potatoes. ??Will go again!
5,-1,"This place is worth driving out of your way to, no matter where you are coming from. ??Make reservations or bust! ??I used to date someone who brought me here all the time, and I loved dressing up to make it a special evening. My favorite is their ""Mezza Luna Ravioli"", which is home made raviolis stuffed with mascarpone cheese, freshly made pesto, and served with an authentic walnut sauce that I haven't had anywhere else, which is made with asparagus, brandy and walnuts, I just can't figure out what else they put in it. I've also had their grilled octopus (which was smoky in flavor, I'm not sure how they got it to be so smoky) and seared blue marlin (which was impeccable in flavor, I'm just not sure how they make it so good). ??I have only had blue marlin one other time in my life, which was a five star restaurant as well, and couldn't resist the opportunity. Their Mediterranean sea bass is another favorite of mine, which is highly recommended."
5,-1,"Bohemian has definitely become one of our favorite places. ??Great food..wonderful service..cool, cozy, intimate ambience..so comfy, you'll end up chatting and sharing dishes with next tables. ??Tried too many delicious dishes to list all..with one exception..just one; husband and I had beef with their sliders. ??Why put mayo & ketchup on really good meat? ??We would've preferred w/o. ??I still love you, Bohemian!"
5,-1,I love this place. It is hard to get a booking but you can usually walk in and sit by the bar. Everything we have had there is delicious but my current favorite is a pasta with a mushroom ragu. This is to die for!
4,-1,"food was very rustic and yet it was very flavorful... Appetizers were light and delicious, also fried chicken was the best among the entr??es. Great for a quick small meals .."
5,-1,Wonderful classic pizza with just the right crust and super fresh ingredients. ??Add a nice ambiance and great selection of drinks -- this makes for a winning combination. Highly recommend!
3,-1,"I totally agree with Jonathan G. ??Went there today for a pastrami sandwich based on the positive review in Wednesday's NY Times. ??The sandwich was tasty, but the pastrami was skimpy (by new york city deli standards). ??Counter service was friendly and efficient, but with a small crowd, it took way too long for the cooks to deliver a simple sandwich. ??Also, I expected a pickle on the side, but alas there was none. ??It was very annoying that most of the tables were filled with computer users (I counted 6 laptops) who were sprawled out with empty coffee cups sitting next to them. ??Apparently it's a great place to buy a cup of espresso and spend a few hours using free wifi. ??All the while the lunch crowd was jostling around trying to find two seats together. ??I'll give them another try (the cortado looked yummy) but if the same issues are encountered, I'll go somewhere else."
5,-1,I love this place for the food and the charm. Is it a 5-star like Per Se? No; but not every top restaurant needs to be a formal culinary experience. The owner's wife often mans the bar and she's really friendly. I love the brunch - especially the side of lentils. And the coffee is really good. This is a great spot to grab a bite with friends or on your own. Definitely get dessert!
5,-1,"Favourite ramen in the city! The Totto Spicy Ramen is perfection. Service is no-nonsense but polite and efficient. Of late, I've been going solo. Each time I was seated immediately at the counter (which is prime seating in my opinion) and in and out probably in 20 minutes. It's really not a place to linger and catch up with friends, so I highly suggest not going with a big party or a long lost friend. Go purely to enjoy the ramen."
4,1,"Great to have quality tacos on the west side. ??I like that this taqueria has a limited menu - tacos and quesadillas - and the food quality is very high. ??In fact the tortillas are made on premises. ??Fillings are also limited to beef, chicken, pork and cactus. ??Tacos are small and cheap so, a fella should order three - ??a lady might want two. The process of getting food is an assembly line: order, pay, get receipt, stay in line, give receipt to food preparer, get food, eat food. Downside is the location. ??As much as I like the idea and design of Chelsea Market, it is a zoo. ??This food stand is doing well but will do much better when it moves to its own space. ??This is finger food and after I finished eating, the hand-washing option was to stand in a long line for the public washroom. Food is great, simple and cheap!"
1,-1,"Extremely disappointing! ??I have lived in New York for over 25 years and have tasted much better Italian food for less than half the price. ??When a family member visiting from out of town suggested that we meet at this restruant, my family and I had our doubts since the restruant is located in the ""touristy"" area. ??We were taken with the ambiance and the friendliness of the staff. ??However, the bread turned out to be the best part of the meal! ??Three of us ordered the lasagna at $27 each (a speciality of the house). ??The presentation was ""artsy"" however, it turned out to be one-dimensional: little cheese, little sauce and very greasy. ??In fact, at least three tablespoons of grease leaked out of the leftover bag! ??One of us ordered pasta carbonnara; the portion was very small and again it was loaded with grease! Our visitor ordered a fish dish, which she said was good, but like the other dishes was swimming in butter. ??In all, these five dishes (no drinks, no extras) cost $153! I am disheartened that this restruant is not up to the standards of NY cuisine. ??In fact, it leaves tourists with the misimpression that NYC food is overpriced and mediocre."
5,-1,"this gem should be rated a triple a! ?? everything about this restaurant is exceptional from the managers, bartenders, waiters, busboys to the fab mojitos and incredible cerviche to the anbiance, music, hip crowd etc. no detail is overlooked! iihave not experienced such attention to service anywhere in a long time. ??kudos to this great hideaway !"
5,-1,"Totto Ramen is by far the best ramen place in NYC. The ambiance is authentic and no-frills, the staff is super nice and the food is excellent. I used to live around the corner and would wait 3+ hours to come here. I've recently moved downtown next to other reputable ramen places such as Ippudo and Momofuku, and Totto's is way better. Plus, they have seasoned avocado, which is so good. The only caveat is that they no longer offer the half-boiled egg, which is one of my FAVORITE things on the menu and I wish the chef would put it back on! I would be so thrilled to have my favorite item back at my favorite ramen spot. Then, I'll still make the 40-block trek to come here. Yum!"
4,-1,great burgers if your willing to wait for them late night. best to head there during the day for a more relaxed atmosphere.
1,-1,"Long story short: - Food is great - Staff is f* shit Waitress for rude because my girlfriend didn't order wine immediately, in Europe we like to pair the wine with our food.. Same waitress forgot to put bread on the table and sneered when we asked for it. I've been looking around for a new glass of (too expensive) wine but there was no one who would look our way. After the main course we had a cheese platter, again no wine was served. After the cheese platter we got presented the check.. But we still wanted desert and coffee. After the plate with the cheesecake was literally thrown on my table I had enough of it and decided not to tip at all. This was really the worst customer service we've experienced in NY"
4,-1,love this place... awesome atmosphere and will be coming back

2,1,"This review is for brunch and brunch only. Wouldn't recommend it to a friend. Only an enemy. Limited menu. My group and the only group in the bar were told that we couldn't turn on 1 of the 6 TVs to the Eagles game bc their was some boring ass other game going on. It's not Giants. It's not Eagles... So does it matter? I had the Alfie's Pale Ale and it tasted like metallic water. Worse than Coors. I swear that's possible.I asked to return it after the first sip and the waitress still charged me for it. I was then served a raw, straight up raw, chicken sandwich. It was thawed, but there was no visible signs that it was ever on a grill. Because I didn't have my beer, I couldn't even count on alcohol to save me from salmonella!! I feel like I need to give it one more go- this time at Happy Hour- before I loyally return to the always impressive Valhalla across the street."
3,-1,"I say 3.5 stars. ??Rocked their brunch; Food-Good, Beer-Good, Service-Horrendous. Sorry to Say, and that is the same feel we as groups received at their sister location Sunswick. ??Something left to be desired."
5,-1,Stop reading!! And come to JoJu for their amazing sandwiches
5,-1,"An update to my review- I tried their seafood dishes twice. I ordered choritos a la chalaca which is mussels with a seafood, onion and tomato mixture on top. The first time they didn't get the order right and I ordered a mild spice, and it tasted good but left a very fishy taste in my mouth afterwards. I decided to try it again and the waitress was friendly, attractive and attentive and the mussels were huge. I ordered it spicy so maybe that helped in it not being fishy. I'm looking forward to trying more of their exotic dishes."
5,-1,The roasted vegetables are the best I've ever had anywhere. They are perfectly roasted and carmelized - the combo plate is simply delicious! I've had them in a sandwich also. Either way - divine!
5,1,"Excellent! Food was so yummy and tasted fresh. Everything we had tasted as if it were a home cooked meal from mom's kitchen. The owners ??are also really sweet and made sure we were satisfied with our meal. I usually don't like it when people keep checking up on you and asking if you need this and that every 5 minutes but it wasn't like that at Juniper. They would nonchalantly pass by look over and refill our drinks, napkins, bring over more gravy (which was a plus!) I just hope this spot doesn't become so popular and over crowded ??becoming like all the other overfilled hipsterlicious dining establishments in the hood. Almost makes me want to erase my review........."
5,1,"Yum, yum, yummy!! Even though there are a ton of reviews, I really wasn't expecting too much. ??After a long day of walking, my friend and I just popped in here for lunch. ??We just had to get the BLT bloody mary and thank goodness... it totally re-energized us, what with the crispy bacon and the pickled hard boiled egg! ??DELISH! ??We split 2 dishes: the biscuits and sausage gravy as well as the grilled salmon salad. ?? Biscuits and gravy: it's not the prettiest dish but the taste beats pretty into it! ??So good! Grilled salmon salad: this was the waitress' recommendation and we were both shocked she had recommended it. ??The salmon was cooked perfectly and the vinaigrette paired with it perfectly! Oh! ??We also got a side of the mac and cheese which was huge! ??It was cheesy and gooey and great! ??Although, I don't know if ziti would be my pasta shape choice for mac and cheese... Picked up a jar of the dilly beans and they are so good! ??A little pricey at $11, but they come with a nice mason jar, so I guess that's ok. :)"
4,-1,"Pros: Great atmosphere, perfect for groups. We went there to celebrate my birthday and it was wonderful. We got a table in the candlelit courtyard that reminds you of a little village in Spain. The cheeses are delicious. There is such a wide selection of very good wines, I was amazed. Cons: Not all the dishes are good. I ordered gnocchi and they were very heavy and drowning in cream. It lacked some refinement. Another con is the staff. One of the hostesses and the waitresses were so rude and inefficient. I was quite surprised when the (tall) hostess said angrily: ""move your stuff from the chair!"". No please, no thank you, not even a look. Just because I had put a bouquet of flowers on the empty chair next to me. But we didn't let it ruin our dinner. I definitely recommend it as the place itself and the cheeses/wines are great! I was very happy with the evening. A very nice birthday dinner! One more thing: the place gets very crowded, very fast, so call ahead to make a reservation. And they have a Nutella cake...;-) Went there on 9/30/2010"
5,-1,"Luv, luv, luv this wine bar. The service is uber-accommodating, especially if you have a large group. ??Excellent Italian wines and wonderful cheese. Normally, I won't cross 14th Street, but it is worth it for pretty good Italian fare, a very romantic environment, and being treated like the Princessa I am."
4,1,"Cuba, Cuba... what can I say? Great food. Apps are amazing! Empanadas, papas rellenas, chorizo, pinchos were all great. i ordered the churraso as an entree - all delicious. so full by the end of it. Mojitos are on the sweet side, but then again that's probably how it's supposed to be. I'll stick to my vodka-seltzer next time. Desserts - tres leches was okay. friends got the bombon cubano and loved it. the venue is a bit cramped. there's live music on certain nights which makes it really fun. Overall great time."
1,-1,"Extremely rude service and restaurant policy, our party was told to wait in a tiny space in the back of the restaurant by the restrooms while we waited for our whole party to arrive. the manager snatched away our menus after she seated us at a table for 6 ( even though we were still missing one person). After we were served water and looked at menus, the manager came by and grabbed away those menus, accusing us of trying to trick the system, by telling them we had less people in order to get seated sooner. ??Without listening to our explanations (that we had told her 6 beforehand) she told us to get up. ??I was really excited to try the restaurant out but after being treated terribly, we left. I've never experienced such terrible customer service and an unwillingness to listen to reason. HORRIBLE. for the sake of all that is good and yummy... don't go."
5,-1,The bone marrow and short ribs are my favorite! One of my favorite restaurants in the city!
3,1,"1 hour wait on a Sunday night an hour before they close their doors.. We ordered the calamari and tzatziki for appetizers.. don't overload on the bread! you'll be too full to finish dinner. MUST is the greek salad.. It comes with kalamata olives, tomatoes and large square slices of imported greek feta cheese! Its so fresh and light, great to start off a meal. Jumbo Scallops $28/plate- baked in a load of butter and comes out nice and full of flavor. the scallops on the sides are nice and a little crispy from being on the edges, great tasting.. you can dip the bread in the sauce to soak up all the juice! Pork Kabobs was nothing significant. Dry and very boring actually.. comes out on a bed of lettuce and side of tzatziki sauce.. even squeezing a lot of lemon on this won't bring flavor into it. Branzino- was soft and delicate. It came out de-boned already but be careful for the tiny ones that they miss! All in all it was okay. I'd go back again, but maybe skip on the pork kabobs and grapleaves.. ehhhhh"
5,1,"Absolutely delicious. ??The space is lovely, and the staff was incredibly friendly. ??I came for brunch and had the egg white frittata."
5,1,Alright...so i bit the bullet and went in for a quick falafel on the way home 4 days ago after randomly reading about it on City Search one day as one of the 'Best of the Best'. ??I've never had really a desire to eat Falafel..just randomly read about it one day on the subway on something someone printed out. ??I've been back each day since. ??I find myself even thinking about it while walking to work at 7AM today. ??This is going to be my obsession for the next month. ??For $2.50 its really something. ??Myself being a true meat lover I'm absolutely amazed by the idea of something with no cow or chicken in it tasting so good...but it does. ??I won't go on and on since all the reviews say the same thing..so... In short: Spend the $2.50 on a falafel sandwich and stop thinking about it :) P.S. Yelp = 30 times better than City Search
4,-1,Such a good restaurant. The food was top notch and the atmosphere was fun and lively. I'd definitely go there again on my next trip to NYC.

4,-1,One of my favorite Italian restaurant in NYC. A Little touristy but so what.. the foods great and the staff is warm and efficient. Get the meatballs!
4,-1,This place is interesting because its like a cafeteria style restaurant. You can pick from a large selection of food and its a great atmosphere. Very casual and great food.
5,-1,"MY FAVORITE UWS RESTAURANT This place is always awesome and everything about the food is perfect. The Sangria is delicious and there are probably like 10 varieties. The bread is very unique- I believe a waitress once told me it was made of yucca flour. But soooo delicious. I have had chicken, steak, and fish here and all have been cooked to perfection. The duck was also quite unique, although of everything, perhaps not my favorite. the lobster and grapefruit ceviche is to die for- I highly recommend it as an appetizer. The focus is definitely Latin, so if you don't like Latin food, don't come expecting to find a hamburger or pasta on the menu. ??Although it is pricey, the entree portions are huge! I have never eaten more than half a meal here! Meat dishes come with plenty of veggies and fried rice (so unhealthy but absolutely delis), so you'll never leave full. Definitely a hard place to eat healthy though- the ceviche dishes are truly appetizers (too small for a meal), and no salads. Great service and ambiance- comfortable, low lighting, the booths are very private. With the amazing drinks and such an ambiance, it is a perfect date place!"
5,-1,"Went with a girlfriend from college, great place to catch up with old friends. Very small, only like 8 tables but great atmosphere. Very reasonably priced for New York. It seems that the rest of the Italians in New York think that you have charge $40 and entree to be taken seriously. We got a lovely prosciutto appetizer, a glass of wine each, paninis and excellent cannolis for dessert. I am a cannoli snob and these were delish! They glass of wine was HUGE, more like two at most restaurants. I don't know about the portions being tapas, they seemed pretty standard sized to me which was great for the price. Best of all, the waitress was great and we didn't feel rushed to leave at all."
4,-1,Test test test
5,-1,"Their strong point is sauces, I've probably could eat anything with such a tasty sauce. I prefer eastern cuisine for its spicery. Of course you should have a skill to prepare all this dishes. Once I found a recipe of their speciality in the Internet and tried to make it myself. My dish was far not so tasty as theirs. So I have stopped trying to do it myself and just prefer to visit them on weekends."
1,-1,"I used to love this place, but last time I went (about 2 years ago) I got campylobacter (food poisoning from eating undercooked poultry) which made me very sick within an hour of finishing my dinner. ??It makes me sad because the food tasted good, but I'm not risking my health for that again."
4,-1,This was a wonderful experience for dinner. It was surprisingly inexpensive and very good!!
4,-1,"This place is awesome, Nice little atmosphere, awesome food, my water needed ice... but other than that no complaints here"
4,-1,Great staff. The manager Carlos makes you feel welcome. Try their sangrias it's the best. Overall great experience
4,-1,I have been here 3 times and all have been good. The steaks are great and the burger was excellent. I think the burger is pricey for what it is but its worth having once. The drinks are also very good and the service is good.
5,-1,Great food and great drinks. Ambiance is awesome. The server who took care of us Alexandra Sanchez really knew the menu and gave me some great suggestions. Will definitely be coming back to this restaurant and will be asking to have her serve us again!
5,-1,"My favorite restaurant in the UES. We have dined here a lot and the experience has always been consistent. Any time we visit, the restaurant is buzzing. The indoor space appears slightly cramped but it's nice and cozy. The outdoor garden is great both in summer/winter as it has space heaters. The menu has great variety, however as of late we go on Monday nights for their meatball specials. I cannot flaw the food, the portions are perfect and at very reasonable prices. Service is great and the waitstaff have always been very helpful and attentive. Every time someone visits me in NYC, I make sure to bring them to Uva!"
5,1,"Delicious thin crust pizza! ??Had the individual Margherita pizza, house wine, and a totally decadent cannoli. ??Beautiful interior and lovely staff. ??A wonderful addition to our neighborhood!"
4,1,"This is a great place to have a relaxed wine and graze on meat, cheese and small plates. It's not pretentious, the staff are friendly and I've not seen it so busy that you can't get a seat. Definitely a good place for a date. The wine list is full of things you won't have heard off but that's great because it gives you an excuse to ask the very helpful bar and wait staff for recommendations. If nice they'll give you some to try before you commit - just like Santa but the present is alcohol! In fact my favourite place to sit is at the bar because you get even better attention. ??You're definitely find something you like. Food is delicious with a large range to suit all tastes. It's small plates designed to be shared but a warning the price can add up. I have to give a shout out to the fried chicken with homemade sriracha sauce. It's Japanese style and they use thigh meat so it's nice and juicy with a little bit of fat left on ??for extra flavour. The homemade sriracha is well balanced between hot and sweet. Good vegetarian options too! Bottom line - great wine, food, a little pricey but equally good for a quiet night out or a more elaborate affair."
2,-1,"Noodles are good, the booth is not flavorful."
4,-1,it was good
4,1,"We are sorry we waited two years to come here. Yes it is ""bar food"" but kicked up by two notches. Our server Paolo was/is professional, knowledgeable and personable! We are not beer/bourbon/scotch drinkers which they heavily advertise on...which is why we never stopped in since we live in the neighborhood. We drink vodka/tequila...they offer 3 vodkas and tequila. We ordered a regular margarita which was delicious. ??Yes they have a wall of TV'S...which they were so kindly changed the channel of a TV that was closest to us so my husband could watch a specific game. The music was a tad loud and not to my husband's liking...would we go back...YES! It's not a sit down restaurant, but you have many options in terms of beer/whiskeys and we received great service from Paolo and the food/drink runner. We wish the place/great success and hope to see you soon!"
3,1,"Great atmosphere, definitely where all the young and hipster New Yorkers go for a Sunday brunch. Food was good. I thought it was a little overpriced, however. The kale salad is good in that it is a plain salad (my friend added eggs to her; the yolk and kale tasted delicious together). The corned beef hash was very tasty. My friend had the french toast - also flavorful. Overall a great experience. You should eat here if you haven't yet! I just expect a little more for the price."
4,1,"Loved this place. It feels very authentic. It definitely took me back to Thailand. The food was delicious, but not amazing. I'd come though. Again the whole feel of the place is about as authentic as it gets!"
5,-1,"Great, cozy little place with a lot of charm. We've eaten here on at least 5 occasions and it is very good food - ??it is authentic and tasty and the waitstaff are very friendly."
1,-1,"after waiting over 30 mins for 2 order of take out i finally gaved up,cashier was rude saying i was at fault for never asking how long it would take them to cook,i been to many places and orders would be out within 15 mins and all i asked for was just a simple beef chow fun,and a wonton soup.this place is just over rated with bad service."
5,-1,"My new Favorite place! Not only is the menu amazing but with the hospitality and ambiance to match! ??I feel like I'm a guest at a friend's house for dinner rather than a patron at a restaurant..... Thanks Jorge, just what the neighborhood needed!"
5,-1,"I have eaten here a few times, and have ordered for delivery a couple times. I am always very pleased! ??Food is just amazingly delicious. I never had anything like it. Service is always fast and all of the staff are friendly! Gaia Italian Caf?? is currently one of my favorite Italian restaurants!"
5,1,"I've eaten here a handful of times- great food, wine, atmosphere, super friendly staff. Did I mention the food is great? ps, PORK BELLY FTW."
5,-1,"I went there for lunch with some co-workers and had the truffle burger. ??OMG, probably the best burger I have ever had if not one of the best. ??All my colleagues had different burgers and all raved about the taste and quality. ??The tempura onion rings, fried pickles and sweet potatoe fries do not disappoint. ??This is a defnitely must if you are in town and want to enjoy an incredible burger and hang out at a cool place to devour it. ??Can't wait to go back and try a different burger."
2,1,"Had the squid ink pasta. ??Sorely disappointed. ??Bland, flavorless, boring. - the size of the shrimps were wonderful though. The atmosphere threw me off a little. ??Made me feel like they would have rather be a club, with bottle service, rather than a restaurant. ??May be back - Don't know yet - wouldn't count on it. I feel like Yelp failed me on this venture as I was looking for good Thai food in my area and was lead to this place."
5,-1,"Great pizza! I love the flavor of the sauce, it's very fresh tasting. I love BYOB places. ??Times are rough in NYC. ?? I recommend that you get extra basil & be a little patient as there is a wait. The wait is worth it."
4,-1,"Working across the street from the store, I waited patiently for Nam Nam to open because I wanted a good place to buy tea. ??I wasn't disappointed. ??I enjoyed their green tea; the chai brought a smile to my lips; the two ""sandwiches"" I tried delighted me. ??Co-workers tried the ice green tea and found it refreshing. ??I definitely am happy that we now have this new cafe across from work. ??The staff is friendly and very willing to accommodate."
4,1,"BYOB Cash is King Mussels Provincial is out of this world. Plus, it's a great place to practice your french."
4,-1,"The food here is AMAZING!!! I just have to say that their dry ribs are to die for!! The best part about this place is that their meats come from 100% grass fed animals. ??The worst part, they have no liquor! Boo! LOL ??But really, try this place and try their Burnt Ends!! They were delicious as well and sell out really quickly. ??The cool thing is that they don't have a refrigerator beyond the refrigerator display for their meats out front which means they don't freeze anything--ALL FRESH! Can't wait to go back when I'm in Astoria again! TRY IT!"
3,-1,Really tasty fried dumplings. What makes it unique is the dumpling skin that they use. It is really thin yet crunchy. The meat inside is also delicious. I do worry about the cleanliness of the place. It is just dirty! But their dumplings are so good...I don't know which to choose sometimes. That's why I give it three stars...
5,1,This is my first time in NY. This place is awesome! Great prices for a homemade meal. Its worth waiting in the long line-they pass out free pancakes and whipped cream strawberries!
1,-1,Our breakfast was a complete disaster here. Food was fine but service was terrible. They would not seat us until our whole party of 4 arrived even though restaurant was empty. While waiting at the restaurant I leant against a ledge that had wet paint but was not signed. It ruined my brand new shirt. They told me it was painted this morning! Why wasnt it signed! Took ages for them to agree to comp our meal. In the end they said the comp was only for my pancakes and a round of drinks. Not coffee or my friends. This was not what the manager had promised us. We ended up paying because the manager made us feel bad about trying to walk on our meal. Complete disaster. Avoid at all costs.
2,1,"Well, well, well what can I say about one of the trendiest Ramen noodle restaurants in NYC. Ippudo left something to be desired. In other words it was disappointing. After a half hour waiting to be seated, we were led to the general dinning area. The decor was very trendy and pleasing to my eyes but after sitting down for a couple of minutes I realized the constant yelling of the cooks and the waiters really started to annoy me. It is hard to have any meaningful conversation with all the noise pollution. My Japanese girlfriend tested the hostesses on their japanese. It turns out that management only train these girls on what to say in Japanese. As they were unable to answer questions they heard in Japanese. Oh well go figure! Well onto the food and drinks, I started out with Kirin Beer. Which is always good and did not disappoint this time. The main dish we had was Shoyu Ramen. That was a big dissapointment. While the broth was mediocre and the noodles were bland. The soup completey lacked or was short on ??some of the traditional items you find like boiled eggs, naruto, scallion. The Shoyu broth was ok but even the pork cutlet was tough and tasted bad.The bowl even seemed smaller than the standard Shoyu Ramen bowl served at many other places I have been to. The other appetizers made up for the Ramen. Kaarage served with spicy mayo was delicious. Tako Yamaimo Ponzu appetizer (Octupus in ponzu ) was also tasty. These appetizers save this shop from getting a complete 1 from me. A restaurant cannot fail on the main dish when that is the restaurant's specialty. They are much better Ramen shops all over NYC. Momofuku, Rai Rai Ken are some that come to mind. Not worth the wait. Only value is if your trying to meet trendy people at the restaurants bar."
5,-1,"Best prepared foods grocery in all of Brooklyn! ??Super fresh and always delicious! ??B introduced me to this fare at our first dinner party, and I've been loyal ever since. ??Joe is the best! Joe 4eva!"
3,1,"Flat Top was SO good but SO expensive. I went here at the beginning of last semester (around August/September) and I haven't been able to come back because of the price, but I think about it a lot. My friend and I got the steak and salmon and IT'S SO GOOD. I highly recommend for those non-budget saving college students."
4,-1,"Love this place! Has great food,and especially fantastic to eat outside in the Summer."
3,1,"This is one these hype turned into disappointment. If it's not because I've been ""rejected"" this place for million times and impossible to get in. I probably would give the place 4 stars. ??The fact it takes such effort to come here makes the food less desirable. Everytime i pass by here ( weekdays/weekends) there is always a crazy line, i read they are known for their breakfast/brunch. I was determined to try at lease once. Lucky I have a friend who lives close by and I can wait at her place. I finally made here one day (weekday) I ordered pancake and southern breakfast. I liked the pancake better but it wasn't fantastic. southern breakfast was so-so. ??Average about 13$ per plate for breakfast + endless wait. ?? I say Clinton St, Baking Company, you only deserve my 3 stars !"
5,1,"I'm convinced that this humble little fry shop was started as a conspiracy to make me fat. I've been going here for fries in the EV since I was a teenager. Years later I'm still helplessly addicted. I've always enjoyed hand-cut fries, but these are something special. They're always fresh, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and pleasantly salty. I love them with mayo, ketchup just too overpowering for frites of this quality. Their flavored mayos are wonderful, but I haven't tried them all. My top 3 favorite mayos are the rosemary-garlic, pesto, and the roasted eggplant mayo. They have something for everyone, and are more than happy to give out small samples of fries to try a taste of the different mayos. Ketchup and regular mayo comes with the fries, but if you want a flavored mayo it's $1 each but well worth it! The container amount is more than enough for a regular size of frites, but if you're ordering larger sizes it couldn't hurt to buy 2. I've found that their smallest serving size is MORE than enough for one, even if they happen to be famished. But they're so good your stomach will magically find room for them all. I noticed they also serve poutine, but I haven't tried it yet. If I do I will post an update."
5,-1,"All time favorite! Great price! For the fresh ingredients and fast service, now that they have a new location just around the corner? This place just keeps getting better. I always come here for the pork with a little spicy (mild). For $3.75? I think anyone can afford this. Always toasted to add a nice crunch, it can get a bit messy because it is so big. But that can't be a negative! Now think.. you pay $5 at subways for a footlong.. why not come here & get a nice big sandwich with MORE meat. Try something new guys. This is amazing!"
2,-1,"I have to admit the food is very good! I grew up around the Ditmars area and really used to enjoy their food. ??My family and I would go there usually more than once a week, but that all came to an end when we saw a rat crawling above us on a ledge. YES I said a RAT. Like I said I do really miss the food, but I could not go back after seeing that."
5,-1,"This is a great place to bring people to if you'd like to impress them. ??The soft warm colors make for an inviting ambiance. ??The chandeliers bring it up a notch to classify the place for the romantic types, yet the unassuming staff make the place very welcoming. ?? As for the food: ??delicious. ??We've been there several times and each time have tried something new. ??When I tasted the Duck Confit Tatertots I knew this place was a keeper. ??Next time I enjoyed the Pretzel Crusted Chicken so tender on the inside and so delicious. ??Next was the Mac N Cheese, loved it. ??And most recently the Scallops which were also delicious and cooked just right. I enjoyed this place enough to keep returning. ??I would certainly return again, in fact, I'd like to bring my mother-in-law for brunch soon."
5,1,"Quaint charming and have never had a bad meal here, wait staff friendly and prompt always a good choice"
2,-1,The food was good but the place is too pricey!
5,-1,"This is the place to go if u love tofu, kimchi & spicy soup. I went there 3X in 6 days! Love the whole fried fish that they serve as a free appetizer, along with kimchi, spinach and the usual Korean side dishes. Ask for more if u are greedy :) for the tofu soup, u can choose from different levels of spicyness (just do regular unless u can take real spicy soup). Real yummy! Oh and they are open 24/7!"
5,1,"This place is solid! Prices are fantastic, food is great, and the staff are super friendly. I ordered the Falafel Sandwich ($3.00), and for an extra $.50 added Hummus. The sandwich is your average size, with three large freshly made falafel balls. It comes with the normal lettuce, cabbage, pickles, tomato, and tahini sauce. You can really tell the ingredients are quality. The falafel isn't oily, like some middle eastern restaurants have a problem with. I've had falafel at many places in the city, and this is definitely in my top three. For a side, I ordered french fries because I can never pass french fries up, especially when they're just $3.00. They're made fresh, and take about five minutes but it's worth it. They may be average, but nothing beats hot fresh fries. The guy put the plate up on the counter when they were done, and my jaw nearly hit the floor. It was like a mountain of french fry heaven. There was literally so many, I barely finished them. Best deal ever. Seriously, I can't recommend this place enough. They've got a pretty large menu featuring many pies, authentic middle eastern sides and desserts. It's got a good amount of seating, although it can get quite busy. It's located literally right outside the Bedford L stop, so tons of people coming and going. Also note, that while they do accept cards, the minimum is $6.00. I can't wait to go back, and try many of the other cheap, and delicious looking options!"
5,1,"One distinct memory I have of all my NYC visits: being introduced to shawarmas and Mamouns at 3AM on NYE's eve. ??Since then, I've had many shawarmas and falafels around the world; all of them were compared to Mamouns. ??I was finally able to make it back there after many trips to NYC over the course of a decade. ??Mamouns didn't fail me, even at lunchtime on a standard Monday. To say that such deliciousness can be served to a hungry family of 3 for under $20?! ??This is definitely as good as it gets! Here's another offering to be lost in the Yelp Sea."
3,1,"Extremely ""clean"" food. A little claustrophobic for dining, so I prefer to order. Took off 2 stars because the black rice is mostly dry when order in a salad. It's never fresh and fluffy. Rice is an integral part of the sushi experience. If they would fix this they would be 5 star*** ***in terms of vegetarian sushi"
4,1,"This is a good place to grab some food when you really don't have any time to cook. I find myself craving the felafel with the spicy sauce. It really is tasty but beware that spicy sauce is VERY SPICY. If you have a weak stomach, don't even try it! But definitely try it out. You'll get hooked."
3,1,"My friend and I wanted a nice quiet place to warm up after a long walk in the cold and we were excited to find a Japanese teahouse. We ordered some dim sum (small snacks for tea) and two pots of tea. We rather enjoyed our tea, but the dim sum dishes left much to be desired. The teahouse had a nice ambience and was ideal for chatting."
5,1,"I couldn't believe it, gumbo in Manhattan? This place does things right with their food. Full of flavor, heat, and generous portions. Their wings are amazing. They're drenched in this spicy/tangy/deliciousness. Save that liquid gold to dip your sweet potato fries in. You will order sweet potato fries right? ... Right? Gumbo was fantastic (shrimp was perfectly cooked, beef was a little chewy though) and this is coming from someone who doesn't usually like anything stewed. My recommendation is sharing the gumbo with someone and getting another plate to share. My date got the chili burger (couldn't share that messy sucker) but I thought that was a silly idea (don't get me wrong, it was good, but why not get their friggin' jambalaya or catfish. I'm coming back soooon to do so. P.S. the cornbread is awesome. Very crumbly and I love those crunchy edge pieces. Butter is a must!"
2,-1,"OK, so we didn't sit at the sushi bar - probably our first mistake. ??But should it really be that if you get seated at a regular table, your meal is going to be so much worse than everyone at the bar? The menu specifies the chef's recommendations for which sushi that were supposed to be the ""freshest"" of the night - so we ordered a sushi/sashimi combo to try a big variety of these chosen fish. Way too salty, way too fishy, and almost inedible. The best fish is never too fishy! Maybe just an off night? ??Or maybe just overrated. check out harrietmagpie.com/?p=1613 for pictures and details of fish."
5,-1,"My son took me there today for a family lunch and it was my first time there. It was a surprising experience as I really did not know what to expect. We had the 5-course tasting menu and the food was exquisite and expertly made. I can't say I recognize everything that was on the plate, but the blend of taste was unexpected. I didn't even realize it was a vegetarian course until the end of the meal. I would definitely come back again."
3,-1,Chef's Table has best food in Brooklyn. Serves fresh food with great environment.
5,-1,"Oh. ??My. ??Gaaaawwwwwdddd! ?? Me: ??Mom, what kind of food do you want for mother's day? Mom: ??Greek food and I want to stay in Queens. Me: ??Well mom, I can't think of a single place in Queens that has decent Greek food... and don't even say Taverna Kyclades! Mom: ??Why not? ??I like that place. Me: ??Sorry mom, we are not going there. ??What's your second choice? Mom: ??Greek food. Me: ??How about your third? Mom: ??Greek food. ??I heard about a new place in Astoria that was excellent. Me: ??Ok, what's the name of it? Mom: ??I have no idea. Me: ??Ok mom, we're going for Japanese. ?? Of course I wasn't going to disappoint mother on mother's day, so I did some research and figured out that it was probably MP Taverna that mother was talking about. ??Made a reservation for four and thinking back, it was probably the best decision I've made all month. The food and service was phenomenal. ??My extremely picky sister sent her wine back, but that's because she doesn't know much about wine. ??She kept saying she wanted something sweet, and the staff did not give up. ??The manager probably gave her a taste of three other wines until she was satisfied. ??The server was also a sweetheart and very patient. ??His jokes were kind of corny, but great personality and service overall. ?? Things to order: -octopus: ??it was cooked PERFECTLY! ??My picky sister even loved it. -lemon chicken: ??I told my father not to order this because he makes some killer lemon chicken, but this was totally different. ??I was tender and juicy. ??The sauce at the bottom of the little cast iron dish was zesty and mouthwatering. ?? -prawn risotto: ??whoa momma! ??creamy, cheesy, hearty deliciousness. ?? - limonada: ??Ouzo and lemonade! ??Need I say more? Didn't get to have dessert because sister wanted to go, but I will try something the next time I'm there. ??By the way, on the way home mom said she has a new favorite Greek place. ??I can't wait to go back. ??Definitely gets my stamp of approval. ??Hands down the best Greek food I've ever had at a restaurant. ?? Note to self: ??Don't dine with sister."
4,1,Beautiful atmosphere and a great choice for a date. The corn that comes with the fried chicken steals the show. The chicken was tender and juicy. It was flavorful and the breading was crisp but not greasy. It is pricey but I guess quality comes with a pretty price tag.

4,1,"Came for a birthday brunch with a friend. Food was tasty, filling, and our server was attentive. We had their sorbet for dessert and it was fresh and delicious. I need to go back here."
5,-1,"The food here is very good. Authentic with fresh, crisp flavours. We had the parpi chat, murgh tikka marsala, the neer dosa, the lamb cutlets, bihari dal, roti and paratha and rice, then ordered Chicken Tandoori (we were already full but kept on eating). The mango Lassi was the best I have ever tried. The atmosphere is lovely. Simple, clean and modern with the perfect lighting. Highly recommended."
5,1,"Simply excellent. The food was marvelous, and the wait staff was a joy to deal with. I definitely recommend it."
4,-1,"Dined here last Friday around midnight. ??Very atmospheric. ??All the dishes we tried were very tasty (steak au poivre, onion soup, moule frites). ??Service was particularly expert, not pushy but solicitous. Highly recommend this New York institution!"
4,1,"This place was really good. ??All the dishes I ordered (mizuna salad, hangar steak and ??the mixed berries shortcake) were all excellent. ??Everything tasted fresh and perfectly complemented. ??My friend ordered the butter clams and the duck. ??I don't usually like duck unless it's chinese roasted duck but I tried a piece and it was pretty delish. The outdoor garden dining area was really cute (I dined inside though). ??The inside was a little loud but not too bad. Service was great too. I would give this 5 stars but I didn't agree with other reviewers that the portions were generous, since after three courses I wasn't totally satiated...but then again, I've been known to be a bottomless pit :-p haha...but all kidding aside, the portions *could* be a bit more and then it would receive 5 stars from me :) I can't wait to go back to try their other meals (brunch and so on!)"
4,1,"Tasty, Mediterranean fare, with a twist on the usual. Green eggs with a quinoa hash brown was a yummy way to kick off brunch. Add in their version of a Pimm's Cup, and you have a happy camper. Spacious dining room with lots of windows and rustic feel. The maitre d' and waiter were really friendly and welcoming. Great addition to Mulberry Street."
4,1,great noodles broth not too greasy. The only problem is you are not allowed to sit across from each other when you are a party of two. If you did there would be a big space anyways ~_~. I guess it makes it more cost effective as they can sit any combination of people anywhere except for big groups that get an actual table. Service was good!
5,1,Sooo good! ABSOLUTELY would come here for lunch and dinner. Fulfilling!
1,-1,"Food was OK - not worth the $$$$$ - Had a reservation for 16 - we were rushed in and out - very rude waiters/waitresses - took the food away while we were still eating Had our family from out of town - they were not impressed at all!! and not worth the 2,000 bill. ??Lots of other great restaurants to go to and be treated much better- will never go again"
4,-1,Been there for several times mostly for brunch. Montecristo is my best and you will find not many places carrying this food and doing it right. Don't forget to add a fried egg on it:))
4,1,"This was our first time here, and we are very impressed. ??I could see this place being in the same category of an Al di la or Blue Ribbon. ??I had the butternut squash soup, which was divine--clearly homemade, not to sweet, great texture, with a delicious hazelnut crunch. ??DH had the buffalo mozzarella, which had a really unique presentation with a fricassee of wild mushrooms and butternut squash, and a brown butter drizzle. ??Fabulous. ??I had the risotto nero for my entree and was blown away by it. ??DH had the black spaghetti, which was good, but we both liked mine more. ??And the affogato desert was perfect too. ??I am really excited to try this place again."
4,1,"So I'm on my New York pizza trip, I'm from San Francisco, my first stop was Lombardis. Excellent place. The next on my list was Rays. Now I didn't know there was like a million Rays! I started to think this was a chain or something! Then I was told the Rays on Prince street is the original. Now Prince pizza. So I went. I had a slice of pepperoni and a slice of cheese. Simple slices that I can make a simple judgement on. I have to say it was really good! New Yorkers have it made when it comes to pizza! I'm not a thin crust guy but Lombardis changed my thinking and now Rays is making me believe it's not a fluke! I really enjoyed the pizza it was crisp with a tangy sauce and tasted oh so good! On to my next destination!"
2,-1,"I used to come here occasionally with my friends but after dining there tonight for the first time in a while, I don't plan on going back. The food is still delicious, but the prices have gone up significantly within the past year, and the service today was sub-par. The cha-an set (basically a prix fixe) used to be $19 and tea was free. Now its $23 plus an additional $5 for the tea = $28 total. (I know restaurants are hurting during this recession, but a $9 price hike in half a year really turns me off). We had to keep on reminding the waitress to refill our teapot, which was never a problem before. To add to the insult, after paying $50 for a $45.5 meal ($4.5 tip), she came up to me and said ""You must have misunderstood. This is only a 10% tip. If there was a problem with the service, let us know, but we expected a $7 tip so please add 2 or 3 more dollars"". This was the first time I've been scolded by a waiter who automatically expects a 15% tip regardless of the service. It really annoyed me, and that's what prompted me to write this review."
5,-1,"Miguel Aguilar, the Chef at Surfish, worked in a few places around town (Peruvian, Asian and others) and over the years has accumulated a vast experience in world cuisine. He is also one of those people that naturally understands the subtleties of fish. I was recently invited to the tastings in his soon-to-be-opened restaurant, his own this time, and all I can say is it was absolutely delicious. Quite simply, it is the best ceviche in town, and it is different and diverse. I highly recommend the white tuna, as well as the tilapia platter over rice (yummy!). The place is small and cozy and has a beautiful backyard for outdoor dining."
5,1,"I will keep it short and sweet. ??Easily the best ramen in NYC (spicy miso is my fave). ??Haven't tried all of the apps but the ones that I did try (the U&I = holy shiat biatch) ??were all 1st class as well. ??The atmosphere is super warm and friendly and I attribute that to the joint being run day-to-day by its husband and wife owners. ??Yes, it takes effort to get yourself a seat here but that's because everyone wants to nom nom on their kick ass food. ?? Duh!"
5,1,"I CANNOT WAIT TO GO BACK! First appetizer that caught my eyes was the SPAM fries! Coming back from Hawaii, my friends and I had been craving spam and to have it fried?! Not only that, they have banana ketchup for dips. Guess what color it was! RED!!! Chicken and Waffle was another great dish. The waffle was crispy and made with ube, purple yam! Chicken was tender and tasty. It was shocking that there was ??a filipino restaurant in the CITY. I always had to go to woodside for filipino food but this was convenient. They have a big window so it was breezy. The young waiters were friendly and have funny t-shirts. Another thing to try is Balut, developing duck embryo! It does look disgusting but I cant wait to try it. I chickened out the first time but i will come back just for it! Right now they are renewing their alcohol license so eat sober but they say drinks will be coming up soon and is advertised on their menu."
4,1,"If you needed any further proof that Franklin on this side of Eastern Parkway has officially become the new Smith Street, this place will put the issue to rest for good. It turns out it winds up being the representation of this in the good way! ??The food is delicious, I've been several times and always enjoyed everything Ive gotten. ??A must order is the houses superlative version of southern ??Spoon Bread, its consistency and amazing point somewhere between biscuit and pudding. ??Its probably best to get it with the delicious fried quail, done in full on southern fried chicken fashion, albeit in miniature. ??Even if you don't get the quail, make sure you order the Spoon Bread a la carte as a side, its that good. ??Octopus, served alongside pork belly on my most recent visit, was perfectly cooked, not overly chewy or rubbery, always a good indicator of skilled hands in the kitchen. ??All the vegetables/salads, like an effervescent kale salad and creamy beet salad, were uniformly excellent and unique. ?? ?? ??The space is impressive and it would have perhaps been impossible for even the most aggressive gentrifier to believe it would be found on this strip 5 years ago. ??Its huge, spacious and sleek, done up in all light wood. ?? A striking, long handsome bar ?? with a solitary TV tucked up in the corner showing sports adding a little casualness to the proceedings, leads to a fantastic looking open kitchen,. ??Service has been pretty solid every time. ??One thing the place could definitely improve is the drinks, they are minuscule, @ least 2 dollars too expensive and decidedly not tasty. ??One drink in particular, better & better tastes like you would imagine window cleaner might. ??Maybe stick to beer and wine for the time being, but nevertheless come here for an enjoyable meal in a shockingly upscale joint. ??This place is great news for anyone looking for yet another good meal option in this area, and yet more bad news for any of the areas renters who surely saw their rents skyrocketing even more when this place opened."
5,1,"Love, love, love Gramercy Tavern! I've wanted to eat here for as long as I can remember... but my first experience in the tavern was well worth the wait. I absolutely have to thank the bf for bringing me as a surprise. The tavern menu (served both during lunch and dinner) is priced surprisingly well, with most apps in the $10-18 range and entrees around $18-26 if I remember correctly. Vast wine and cocktail list, and an amazing seasonal dessert menu by pastry chef Nancy Olsen. The fish croquette and spinach salad with an oyster sauce I tried was savory and perfectly balanced. The fresh fish croquettes were beautifully fried and very very light and subtle in flavor - complimented by the robust oyster sauce. I especially loved the pickled daikon and carrot slaw with a little bit of spice that sat underneath, which added lovely tang and acid. The smoked pork shoulder with a large cornbread crouton, salsify and bacon broth was hearty and delicious as well. I just loved how inherently homey all of the dishes on the tavern menu are, only with more modern flavor combinations and techniques. What really put my meal over the top, warranting 5 stars on here though, was the amazing service. Not only was our waiter perfectly friendly and attentive, but he even went as far as providing two plates for our ricotta cheesecake dessert when we mentioned that we would split it - so that the bf and I each got our own scoop of black currant sorbet and chocolate cookie crumbs. So with that, one order of dessert basically turned into two sizably-portioned desserts! The cheesecake itself was absolutely delightful as well, light and impossibly creamy. I cannot wait to come back for dinner in the dining room. Will surely update after that!"
4,-1,"Small place but flavor-full food , ??highly recommend the pollo guisado con maduros, ?? which is stewed chicken with sweet plantains, ??great portions with the prefect sizzle on the chicken glaze. ?? I would recommend this place time and time again, great meals great service and great atmosphere."
5,1,"Everything here was amazing, from the service to every item ordered."
5,-1,I decided to impress my new mother and father in-law by taking them to a nice dinner. I didn't have to think too much before I knew Nai Tapas would be the PERFECT place. I was DEFINITELY right! From the minute we walked in we were greeted and sat right away. We had a table right in front of the live Flamenco band which was a plus. We ordered a variety of tapas and each one out did the next. The tropical sangria was also very good and the entertainment was amazing! I know I scored some extra points with the in-laws by bringing them to Nai Tapas!
5,1,"Solid 4 stars. Yay! I'm a fan. We ordered the hot soba noodles with tempura. The broth of the soup was amazing!! It kinda has this wood smoked flavor to it, I've never had soup with this flavor before! It was delicious! The noodles were great as well, with good texture. The seating arrangement is pretty crunched into together so you better hope you have good conversation or else you will be entertained by your neighbor. Aside from the smoking hot Korean waitress, serve was decent but not memorable. Prices are pretty much typical of Manhattan, about $18/each for the soba noodles. Will definitely be back here again in the future."
4,-1,"I love this place. ??The sandwiches are all super tasty and they are always open. ??The ""East Side Ink"" or the ""Mona Lisa"" have been my go to sandwiches but as of late I have been getting the ""Bush"". ??They deliver anything too as long as your order is over 10 bucks."
5,-1,"Incredible comfort food. The chicken biscuits are incredible, yummy chicken and flaky biscuits.Then I tried the banana cream pie, and it was heaven. Overall it has a great atmosphere with good service, and very cozy. Would definitely recommend"
4,1,My favourite is the artichoke but the crab deserves a mention also. ??This ranks up amongst the best pizza I've had in NYC - have yet to have a bad experience =)
3,1,"I came for a Sunday Brunch with an reservation. The hostess and server were both very welcoming. I loved the environment and the set up of the place. I'm a big fan of eggs benedict and the ones that caught my eye were potato waffle benedict and smoked salmon benedict. I ended up ordering the smoked salmon benedict, and it was okay. The salmon was way too too salty, it seemed like they've stored it for a long time. The home fries though, was decent. My friend ordered the potato waffle benedict, which was quite unique, I've never seen waffles made out of potatoes. The smoked salmon benedict was a little disappointing. I'd go back to try other things on their menu."
4,1,"Popped my Artichoke pizza cherry with my also first timer friend... We ordered: the Artichoke, Margherita and Crab pizza It was delivered in a timely fashion and still hot... But we both preferred the Margherita and Crab pizza over the Artichoke. Maybe we are just simple pizza lovers, plain ol' tomato and cheese floats our boats It's definitely worth a try. Unless you don't like artichokes. P.S. These pizzas are $4.50 a slice but humongous. It's the same size as my friends head. Check it out."
5,-1,"this is by far one of my favorite ny restaurants. the food is so amazing. i've had so many dishes but those that stand out are the hummus (all flavors), the brussel sprouts, the lamb kabobs and many many others. the drinks are to die for, the service can be a bit slow but just plan on it being a long dinner and head there accordingly. i can never miss a chance to go to ilili when going to ny and can't wait for my next trip to ilili. always recommend it to anyone that asks for a restaurant recommendation."
5,1,"Gaia is the perfect place for those looking for affordable, yet tasty, home cooked Italian food. ??I bookmarked this place due to the great reviews but I had no idea how close my sister's apartment was to Gaia. Perfect! My sister and I split the following for lunch: ARUGULA WITH CHERRY TOMATOES IN PESTO SAUCE WITH PARMESAN SALAD This may seem like a simple salad but this alone wowed my sister and I. ??We both liked how the flavors were balanced out, especially since it's easy for pesto to overwhelm a dish. ??My sis loved this salad so much that she wished she had this all to herself. DELIZIOSO PANINI: We split this panini and they were nice enough to cut it for us. ??This sandwich contained prosciutto, mozzarella, tomato, anchovies, and mustard. ??We enjoyed how light and crisp the bread was, as well as enjoying the freshness of the ingredients sandwiched between. LASAGNE WITH BOLOGNESE SAUCE I haven't had lasagne in ages so I had to get this. ??It was simple but I liked how the flavors of the cheese, bolognese sauce and olive oil were balanced. ??Plus, this was not a heavy dish which is hard to imagine with lasagne. If you're in the neighborhood, give this place a try!"
4,1,"After scanning through piles and piles of menus yesterday looking for the right restaurant, it was this Cubanito dessert that sealed the deal for me. ??Off to Calle Ocho we went! From the start with the truly awesome dinner rolls--which we had to get a heaping second portion of--to the must have desserts, this Latin fusion restaurant on the Upper West Side is absolutely delicious. It is clear that Calle Ocho puts a lot of thought into their flavor combinations while making sure not to go too far out of the box so as to loose the traditional feel of these plays on classic dishes. The lobster mash that was served with my salmon dish was SO DELICIOUS! There were actual large chunks of lobster not-so-hidden in there! And, I must say, the mix of the savory salmon combined with the mango chutney was--as Franklin mocked me for saying--""absolutely lovely"". Back to the sweets... Why not add a side of plantains--PLATANOS--to your dish? More sweet with savory is such a good choice! ??SO YUMMY! Then--as I may have more than hinted earlier--you have to get dessert. Trust me, you'll want your own! SO GOOD! Much in the style of the rest of the Calle Ocho menu, the desserts have a traditional feel with a twist. I LOVE THIS! I mean, the Tres Leches has banana in it! FUN! GO! SALUD!"
2,-1,"Went here last night with my best friend and my girlfriend. We were pretty psyched to get in at 9pm on a monday night after only waiting a few minutes. I had always walked by longingly and went in several times only to be dissuaded by an extremely long wait. The ramen was good but not over the top. Nothing compared to the Momofuku I had last week for the first time. The pork bun was pretty medicore. Good but not great, too much mayo. The tofu-green tea desert was amazing though. The craziest thing happened when my girlfriend asked for one of her veggie buns to be boxed to go. The waitress said ""we don't do that because it ruins the quality of our food."" What kind of tyrannical policy is this? Who are you to determine what I can and cannot do with the food that I rightfully purchased! I asked her if we could have a napkin instead and she refused. She said ""No, because I know what you're going to do with it."" THIS IS CRAZY!!!!! Spare yourself the insanity and eat some better Ramen, go to Momofuku or Minca."
1,-1,"We stopped at Isabella's on 8/31/2013 because it looked quaint and had outdoor seating. The restaurant was quite busy on this hot, Saturday afternoon. My first impression was that of a busy, NYC cafe. Nothing special and nothing bad. While waiting for seating I visited the restroom. Dirty and cramped is the best way to describe it. Xcelerator hand dryer located over the toilet??? Toilet paper on the floor flying all over the bathroom while I'm drying my hands (over the toilet). Gross. Once seated outside, our waitress was friendly but we had to wait a bit for pretty much everything, including a straw. I ordered the chopped salad (think Greek salad) with shell steak. I was very disappointed. the salad had no reall taste and the steak was VERY fatty. At $8 extra for the steak, I was disappointed. 1/2 of the steak was not edible. My daughter had (runny) scrambled eggs since this was still considered brunch. The lemon fries was good. My friend had the grilled chicken skewer salad and said it was tasty. My bloody mary was nothing special, and the more I drank it the more I was questioning the chunks of horseradish that I was swallowing since my experience at Isabella's left me questioning the cleanliness of the restaurant. Our bill came to $64 for 3 people including the bloody mary and a belini. I will never come back here again and I do not recommend this restaurant, especially when there are thousands of others to choose from."
2,-1,dishes were ordinary. don't not seem to have specialty.
4,-1,"This place rocks. It's like eating in your mom's kitchen without actually having to go home. The mac n cheese is some of the best in town, with fontina and cheddar to round out the flavor. And breakfast is served every day, complete with mismatched coffee mugs that make it feel even more like home. Service is friendly and attentive, without being overbearing and you can easily walk out of Penelope for under $15"
3,1,"comfort. this place is all about comfort. until one morning, they ran out of ricotta pancakes [with vanilla marscapone & poached pairs]... that left me a sad bear. went for the bread basket/cestino di dolci [croissant, choco croissant, scone, budino-olive oil muffin & pumpkin bread]. the highlight here was the olive oil muffin. lowlight is the hard scone [must get rid of it...]. of course i had to order the brioche carmellato [toffee glazed brioche] b/c i love all kinds of bread and baked goodies. that soft bundle of love was great! wish i had like 4 more of them. the savory part of the meal was the amatriciana [baked eggs in spicy tomato sauce and guanciale] which was not spicy but i guess it was stupid to expect it to be. also got the frittata bianca [leeks, mushrooms, prosciutto]. this dish was great except all the prosciutto was on one side of the dish... ?? all in all it was a good meal, i'm still sad i missed out on the pancakes. and the amatriciana was good but too savory for my morning. more than anything, the service was good. they're genuine & very nice~ 3.5"
5,-1,"One of my favorite places in the city. Everything is perfect. Service is impeccable. even the extra virgin olive oil that came with the bread was spectacular House Made Ricotta Cheese to start - rich and creamy; taste like butter Charred Octopus - grilled to perfection and incredibly tender Squid Ink Fettucini ??- not a big pasta person but this was great. lots of garlic which is great if you're into that Strawberry Pavlova - unlike anything I've had before. Perfect light summery dessert. Great mix of textures - crunchy pastry shell, smooth and rich creme filling, tangy sorbet Always an amazing experience at L'Artusi. Dining in the private wine cellar with sky roof is for those extra special events."
5,-1,"Love the Pizza with tartufo my favorite, love the decor so welcoming, The owner Sebastian ??is super sweet , The bartender is the nicest girl ever, some of the staff have attitude but other then that , Its an amazing place to eat diner even if its a long wait at times. Surely worth the wait!!!"
5,1,Check the restroom pretty cool
5,-1,"The food is delicious as i heard and the menu is very unique. Everything is made fresh with quality ingredients. Its perfect place for breakfast or lunch for great price. ?? I had to try Memo burger, Its AMAZING!!!! Its perfect amount of house ground beef patty w caramelized onion, fontina cheese on brioche roll...And the fresh cut fries are very delicious as well.. The coffee is Excellent and they make it ??the way you like..It look like they fresh ground beans too.. The service is great with very friendly staffs, The ??space is small but its very cozy and cute. I will definitely be back to try everything on the menu!! I Love the place and the food ."
4,1,"it's summer, which means heavy foods just don't sit well in sticky hot weather. You need something light, yet filling and tasty! Enter La Tarte Flambee! I'm a sucker for great lunch deals, $12.95 for a ""flammy"" + salad + soda = WIN in my book. With so many chocies of savory and sweet flambees, it made the decision a little difficult but not to worry, at a mere 4 blocks away.. i will be back to continue the exploration! in short, need a light bite at a good price? this is your place!"
5,-1,"I love this place. ??EVERY BIT as good as Ippudo with out the WAIT!!! I think their version of shishito peppers are better than Ippudo. ??And their Short Rib buns are out of this world. ??I think I could gorge on these alone. Their ramen has more depth of flavor than Ippudo's and I didn't get that buzz that I normally do from MSG as I did at Ippudo. ?? Both places are great, but Zutto has NO LINES. ?? I would go here if I had a lot people joining me, but I like ippudo only because of the scene."
5,1,Great selection of wines and a wonderful cheese platter. Service was AMAZING. If your near 72nd and Columbus you need to make a stop here.
5,-1,"Finally! went to eat at Amy Ruth's and I was glad we drove from Bedstuy, Brooklyn to Harlem. It was a quiet and hot Friday evening uptown. Our food came super fast and the waiters were attentive and patient. They even bought our 3 year old his own slice of cornbread. The Al Sharpton was amazing! The waffles were so soft and they had real maple syrup. We finishes in 1 hour total. Spent 75$ for 4 meals, and Kook-aid I will go back definitely!!"
2,-1,"Being a Paleo fanatic I was so psyched for this place to open as there is nothing in the City -- to the best of my knowledge -- with Paleo as a concept. And to top it off, it is right near where I live. Imagine the possibilities. ??Now, even though I have eaten there several times (again, there are no Paleo options and only in dire situations will I still eat here!) I am not happy with this place and wish it made major improvements. The food is way over-priced and to be honest not that great. I can cook most of the things they make and was hence expecting a lot more creativity. It is almost impossible to get out of there with a simple takeout meal for under $20 as apart from the chicken meal ($20!!!) the way things are proportioned is very confusing and illogical. They have so many options in a cold bar setting that they will not warm up for you, but even if they did, why can't they pick fewer things and have them hot and fresh? Further, they have to measure each cold item one at a time, so if you wanted a meat and two sides, they literally have to weigh each one at a time and then put it on a plate. It takes way too long for food that is a slight step up from the Wholefoods salad bar. Did I mention how expensive they are? Last time I was there $12 bought me two tiny pieces of turkey meatloaf served cold without a side dish. I was starving afterwards! They used to have really good chicken wings that were free range and reasonably priced, but I guess that wasn't good enough for them and they scrapped them from the menu. ?? Finally, and this is annoying, they put these little quotes and words of wisdom on a sign outside from time to time. While I am not a nutrition expert, I do know the difference between grassfed, free range, pasture raised and all the other words of Paleo wisdom. Apparently, their expert doesn't as I have seen numerous signs with mistakes on them."
5,1,"I tried to come on opening day, but the wait was going to be at least 3 hours and it was already 7:30. Not trying to eat burgers at 10:30 on a Monday like I'm 20 again and back in college in some wonderful, wonderful alternate universe the beauty of which is so intense the mere visualization of it threatens to overwhelm me. Finally got to test the hype this afternoon and SWEET JESUS did they hit the mark. The truffle burger might actually be too delicious. I was nervous when eating it. I felt unworthy, like I was eating food intended for somebody better than me - like angels or professional athletes. Only complaint is that they treat the sides like starters. It is thoroughly bizarre to me that anybody could possibly want french fries or onion rings (which are delicious) before their burger, but then again there are lots of things I don't get about California."
3,1,"Good ramen, probably one of the best in NYC. ??However, it's unlikely that you will be seated in anything less than 40 minutes. This is a popular place... so be forewarned."
5,1,This place blew my mind. ??It is the only authentic ramen that i have tasted in America. ??I grew up in Japan and have been missing the taste of authentic ramen so I was thrilled to be introduced to this place. ??I had the miso ramen but I've heard everything is good there from my friend who eats there often. The chef is talented and authentic. ??We spoke in Japanese and he was very friendly.
3,1,"Good burger, solid date place if it's blind. Big open space, easily can seat you on a busy night. VERY attentive wait staff. Charging for refills of iced tea? That is definitely a no-no."
4,1,"I enjoyed the casual atmosphere and savory tapas. The waitress brought the tapas here quickly. Sangria was very drinkable. Indeed, it was how I have always imagined a sangria should be. The scallop special was cooked nicely and the gambas (shrimp) were tasty. The Deviled eggs, chicken liver pate, and croquetas are pretty good as well. overall, the restaurant was very pleasant. solid tapas joint."
5,1,"OH MY GOODNESS. Thank god I came to the Chelsea Market today and had food from this place. The food that I ordered (carne asada quesadillas with everything in it, on corn tortillas) was so, so, SO delicious. I nearly cried after my first bite. It was THAT good! The meat was so flavorful, and everything was fresh. And I also loved that they actually make your food right in front of you. I guess my only ""negative"" comment about this is that their portions are small. Don't just order one item because it won't be enough. Trust me. Today was my first time here, but it definitely won't be the last. Please do yourselves a favor and try this place out. The line will be long but, man, it'll be so worth it."
4,-1,"While stuck on jury duty I ended up here. Line down the block, all locals. Must be good I thought. After 20+mins in line I finally get in the door and it's just one guy chopping up random meats and putting as much as he can into to-go boxes. Got the roast pork and duck per reviews. Huge portion, too much to eat, for less than $4!! The duck was good and crispy but cold by the time I got to it. The pork was great. ??Rice and veg, are just rice and veg. Definitely worth the wait if you have the time."
5,1,"Have been several times and again the other night. Everything we ordered was sublime! Oysters, foie gras, black sea bass in bouillabaise, the lamb... Service friendly, professional, non-stuffy. Room beautiful -- we love the strikingness and intimacy of the red room. Will be back many more times!"
5,1,"Darling, delightful, delicious... I had the loveliest lunch here. I ordered the Proper Tuna Sandwich. It was, hands down, the best tuna sandwich I've ever had. Crusty French bread, perfect soft boiled egg, tuna, haricots vertes and, instead of mayo, fruity delicious olive oil. Amazing."
1,-1,"While the pizza might be fine for a drunken adventure, the staff is terrible. The cashier has nothing more to bark than, ""cash only"" (with no signs to support) and the bouncer (that's right a pizza place bouncer) randomly decides when it is and is not appropriate for people to eat pizza inside the establishment. If this pizza was mind blowingly amazing i wouldn't have posted this scathing review, but with mediocre pizza a nice staff is all they should aspire to. Since they don't even have that..."
5,1,"Oh my gosh, where do I start? ?? We had the whole place to ourselves last Saturday from 1 to 4pm as part of my friend's farewell party. ??From the moment we stepped in, the owner, Natalie welcomed us with a warm greeting and with her assistant, served us drinks. ??For $40 per person (this includes tip and tax), we got unlimited sangria and very good selection of tapas. ??The white and red sangria were tasty and refreshing (One was a pomegranate mix and the other a pear mix). Virgin sparking strawberry sangria was available for non-drinkers and beer for non-sangria drinkers. ??We also had a taste of red and white blended wines from local wineries in Spain. The rotating tapas were all incredibly good and tasty and ??contained real Spanish spices and ingredients. Chicken empanadas were to die for! Croquettes, shrimp skewers, meatballs, papas fritas with special sauces, lobster bites, bruschetta with tomatoes... Ok, I'm not doing justice to the menu but trust me, everything tasted damn good! Excellent service, delicious food and drinks, awesome company, intimate space just for ourselves and beautiful weather. I mean, really, what more can you ask for? $40 is such a bargain for this experience."
5,-1,"Delicious pierogies, keilbasa! Two thumbs up!!!"
2,1,Not the best at all. ??Fries cut too thick and potatoes did not have a yummy flavor. Sadly. Very disappointed. ?? One good thing was the curry sauce. SpIcy and delicious and very authentic. Doubt i would ever go back. ??I honestly have had better fries at Five Guys.
4,-1,great place and food for good prices.. one of my fav places to go to on a date or with friends
5,-1,"Calle Ocho is my favorite Cuban restaurant. I was there Saturday with my friends visiting from Chicago and they were blown away by this place. The ambiance, the food, the service. I rate it 5 stars. I will go back there for sure and I'm recommending it to my friends."
3,-1,"The only reason anyone should ever wait for a table at this place is for the Pancakes! AMAZING! My friend and I started out with the Egg Benedict with salmon and the Spanish Omelet, we also had tea. The problem with both of these dishes was that they came out cold. Even our tea was barely luke warm. WTH? The Egg Benedict would have been a whole lot better had it been hot, the spanish omelet was more like baked eggs than an omelet and neither one of us liked it. The Pancakes with the berries made up for it though, absolutely amazing! I would never go to this place again if not for those pancakes. YUM. 5 Stars for the Pancakes, less than 3 for everything else!"
5,-1,"The food and service are great. You'll find the best Calamari ever at Joya. I mean THE BEST,!!!! ??Food never goes wrong, great outdoor setting for summer. The food here is really good. ??Though not the BEST I have ever had, it's up high on the list. ??I especially love the Pad See Yu. ??Their fusion dishes are definitely worth a try. ??Delivery is always prompt. Because it's right near Smith Street, the place is a hipster death trap on the weekends. ??Don't bother going unless you want to wait for at least 30 minutes. ??Also, it gets LOUD, crowded, and unpleasant at these times, even by NYC standards. Great ambiance with really chill music and hip crowd. A great experience after all! We will be back! Its CASH ONLY!!"
4,-1,"Lovely place, great atmosphere...wonderful selection of wine. ??Waitstaff is classy, knowledgeable and non-invasive. ?? Have only tried a couple of small bites, very good. ??Sat in the window with a friend on a Sunday at 4P and it was lovely to have a great glass of wine and watch the world go by. ??Although wines are not inexpensive, you are sure to try something you haven't heard of before and love it."
1,1,"This place has the worst service I have ever had in NYC, and I've lived here since 1996. ??I went back a second time thinking it was just an off-night. ??BIG MISTAKE. ??Both times the wait was endless. ??Finding a server nearly impossible. ??And the food??--mine literally came out 40 min AFTER my date had FINISHED theirs. ??CLOSE THIS PLACE NOW!"
5,-1,"Spectacular food, great service, and an amazing open service area. I like the prix fixe menu. The food was just amazing, spiced perfectly and presented beautifully. While the main courses are small, I certainly did not leave hungry. The wine was excellent and I am pining to go back already!"
3,1,"My rating is for lunch... my sister had recommended this place so we swung by. Since we had the kids with us, we wanted to go when it wasn't busy... came around 2:30pm. My husband had the croque madame... it was open faced... that was a first. I had the salade with chicken since the waiter recommended it. My kids had the homemade minestrone soup which they loved.... I thought it was a tad too salty. They also ordered the ""best chocolat chaud"" which I would have to disagree... it was watery... the best chocolat chaud is at La Maison du Chocolat- absolutely no comparison. I would have to agree that it's more of a tapas place... the portions were very small and we actually left hungry. I would definitely try to come for dinner to see if our rating would be better."
5,-1,"A great place to meet up with friends or a great place to take your girl for dinner and drinks. ??The food is perfect for the atmosphere and the music isn't too loud, which is great when you're trying to hold a conversation. ??The Flying Pig is a block down, and although they get more hype, I think this place is the best bar in the neighborhood. And if you're not sure what food goes with your drink, I recommend you listen to the bartenders, because they know what they're talking about."
4,1,"The food was really delicious, just walking in you knew you were going to eat well. While the restaurant is small, really a storefront, it just adds to it's charm. We had the steamed dumplings, egg rolls, pad Thai, and ba mee. The appetizers were incredible, definitely some of the best I've ever had. You need to add lemon to the pad Thai, but then the flavors are all perfect. The ba mee was excellent and the pork was soft and moist."
4,1,"What an excellent surprise - Wild Edibles had the most delicious lobster roll and mussels I've ever tasted. ?? The place itself is small, with just a few short tables and a bar surrounding a seafood stand selling fresh fish and crustaceans - as a result, it's very fishy-smelling. ??Not fancy in the least, with a friendly staff and pretty extensive menu for how small the place is. ??I didn't have crazy expectations coming in, especially due to the signage outside being pretty lame. All that being said, the food was absolutely awesome. ??My boyfriend and I were bingeing on New Orleans-Style mussels, white wine and old bay spiced french fries, and additionally split the freshest, crispiest, lightest lobster roll I've ever had. ??5 stars hands-down if the review were for food alone. Murray Hill has a lack of secret fantastic places like this, so I'm really glad I've found it. ??Also, I'll have a great recommendation besides Luke's when friends are looking for good lobster rolls!"
3,1,Food was fresh. Service was good. A tad bit expensive and trendy. ??Would visit if I was in the area.
5,1,"This review is really based on one dish, which I've had the 3 times I've been to UVA.....seafood soup ( it has a fancier name on the menu but this is how I remember it). ??It's ??full of scallops, octopus, prawns, fish....a definite must in winter months. ??Truly spectacular!"
3,-1,"I was excited to try this place out since it opened. The decor is pretty sweet and the beer selection is very good. Did not have any food so I'm unable to critique that. However, there was a ton of people wearing plaid shirts with beards. I suddenly felt as if I was in Brooklyn and not Astoria. Staff was pretty attentive during our stay. Bottom line, if you're into the whole hipster/plaid/beard scene, then this place is probably for you."
2,1,"I visited this place because of the many good reviews and ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich. I don't know of it was the time of day (around 6:30 pm) or something else, but what I was served was simply horrible. The pita bread was in and out the oven within a minute. The chicken meat came out a of a bowl and was already grilled. The sand which was completed with a little tomato salad and a bit of hot sauce. As a result the bread was cold before the chicken was reheated and then chicken itself was so dry and hard you could barely grind your teeth through it. The only edible part was the tomato part, but even that was nothing special. I didn't eat it and threw most of the sandwich away. I know I ate there only once, but that's why I still give two stars instead of just one."
4,1,"Quite the great beer selection here. My latest try was the Flying Dog Raging Bitch. Always down to try some new beers! Love the atmosphere and friendly bartenders. What more can you ask for in a good bar? Tried it the first time with a sick ScoutMob deal and continue going back because it's just awesome. ALSO their playlist in there, sick."
3,1,"Very unique place and very intimate! ??My favorite part of the restaurant was the vibe - a constant buzz of everyone around the restaurant chatting and sipping wine. ??I can be adventurious with food; however, I also like to have a few non-exotic dishes available. ??To my amazement, my favorite dish was Piquillo Peppers with oxtails."
4,-1,"I've been living really close to Roberta's for almost a year now, and tried to stop in several times to eat there (but never wanted to wait). ??We finally ordered from them tonight and had our pizzas delivered. ??I honestly don't know why it took us so long to get their pizza! ??It was amazing! ??And the delivery was fast. ??We ordered at prime dinner time and they said it would be 45 mins - 1 hour, but it showed up about 30 mins after the order was placed. ??We ordered two different kinds and both were great. ??Only complaint is that they forgot the ricotta on one of the pizzas, but that's not a big deal. ??Go get some pizza!"
5,-1,"If you are a burrito lover then I recommend you try this place! Unlike the chain places where the burritos are loaded with cheese sour cream and guacamole in which those 3 ingredients can make a shoe taste good this place has the perfect amount of those ingredients to compliment the delicious seasoning of the chicken and steak. It's not greasy and has the perfect amount of everything that makes up a burrito where you don't feel like you clogged every artery in your body. My husband and I get the chicken burrito with avocado and the cheese empanadas at least once a week for dinner.If you want authentic,fresh,non greasy mexican food then you gotta try this place!"
1,-1,"I would have recommended this restaurant a year ago but my experience this week was a total nighmare. ??The staff was unfriendly to the point of being rude when we asked to see a waitress after sitting for 10 minutes with no one else in the restaurant. ??The food was a total disappointment. ??It started out with the bread being left in the oven too long and had a rancid taste. I ordered the pork chops wrapped in prosciutto and the meat was dry and tasteless. ??My son lucked out with the fish as it was tasty and of good quality. ??My husband had the worse experience as he ordered the paella and was brought a bowl of ""casuelas de mariscos"" which is seafood in a clear broth with a scoop of black rice in the center. ??We mentioned to the waitress that this was not paella and her response was ""if the waiter calls it paella then I have to believe that's what it is!"" ??Needless to say we didn't stick around for dessert and will never return."
4,-1,"Since my last review I have sat at the bar a few times. There are two women who work there that are just lovely. Sweet, knowledgable and really take their time with the drinks. Nice."
5,1,"5 stars for food, 3 for the loud noise. ?? The lobster & crab ravioli is the best! ??great prices and attentive service."
4,-1,"french fries with whipped gorgonzola. nothing more needs to be said here. they're as good as they come. and the main courses -- fish, chicken, salads, meats -- all very good, as well. just make sure you save room for the fries as you'll be ordering them as an appetizer AND as a dessert!"
2,-1,"I can usually be relaxed about what time I have dinner on a Saturday night but that wasn't the case with the folks at Salinas. ??They told me when I made the reservation that there was only a 15 minute grace period and the entire party had to be present. ??Then they phoned me the day before to confirm the 8:30 reservation, once again noting that our table would be given away if we arrived more than 15 minutes late and all four of us needed to present in order to be seated. ??Needless to say we dashed through the streets of Chelsea to ensure an on-time arrival. ??Imagine my surprise when we walked through the door at 8:29 PM into a crowded bar area where we were asked to ""take a seat and we'll let you know when your table is available."" ?? Huh? ??""How long do you think it will be?"" I asked and was told ""a few moments."" ??Given that I figured we'd just wait there in the vestibule but then was informed that the host meant it would be ""a few moments"" before he could tell us how long we would have to wait for our table to be available. ??At that point, I mentioned how punctuality had been stressed so much during the reservation process that I assumed it would work both ways. ??I didn't want to ruin the evening for my guests so we all did move in and stand by the bar. ??No apologies, no offer of a drink on the house. ??Just as the magic 15 minute mark approached, when our table would have been given away, he did manage to get us seated. Well, now that I've got that out of the way: ??the setting is really beautiful and our waitress was very efficient, despite the full house. ??The food was erratic, the short ribs were great, the paella not even in the top 50% of what I've tasted nearby at much less than the $56 cost (for 2) here. ??The tapas are OK, not really exceptional. ??When I go to Boqueria I can never decide which ones to order; here it seemed like a chore to find three or four to share since none sounded very exciting (and they weren't) ??It's a very nice setting, especially the garden in the back, so maybe on another night, when we hadn't rushed out of a cocktail party at a friend's house to get there right on time, it might be a different experience."
5,-1,"My absolute favorite brunch in all of New York City! ??I grew up in the south and the biscuits are fantastic here. ??Try the Sandra and the Nette, but to be honest, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. ??On top of great food, the owners and staff are all really fantastic. ??Small town feel in the middle of the big city, couldn't ask for more!"
5,-1,"Hands down the best pancakes I have had so far. I had the spanish egg dish and my friend got the buttermilk sandwich. Both were very tasty, my favorite is the buttermilk sandwich though.. just delicious! Service is great as well. We were told it would take them 1.5hr to seat us but we received a text to notify that they had a table ready for us from the restaurant under 50 minutes. Awesome place!"
3,-1,"Great experience the several times I've gone: I love the summer rolls ($4?), Thai iced tea and Viet coffee (a bit bitter, but still smooth). Seating is limited. On the expensive end considering other banh mi places in Chinatown/8 Ave, but frequent buyer cards for bubble tea and sandwiches!"
4,-1,"Food was good. But for the price I would go with 11 Madison Park which is more creative and impressive. The mushroom was fantastic. For starters, don't like the overuse of fruits. The main course and dessert were good, but no wow elements."
2,-1,"The food is good but the service is just horrible. You practically have to beg to get attention. Not helpful or friendly. I rather go to a thai place in the city. After hearing so much rave i really wanted to like it but the service lacked so much to desire. Oh and my friend said no ice in her thai iced tea so thy charged her more, like really?"
5,1,"If you are a lover of bourbon, this is your cathedral. Most extensive collection of bourbons in NYC, and a great staff to guide you. Food is yummy too! Go during the week to avoid the crazy crowds, and enjoy the smell of bacon and Kentucky's finest."
3,1,"I went here for brunch on a weekend. ??The jalapeno bloody mary is only $6, but it's really spicy and unfortunately the mix is pre-made with jalapenos, so you can't get a milder version. ??The white sangria wasn't great, but for $5 it's not a terrible deal. ?? The real reason to come here is the fried chicken and waffles. ??The chicken is fantastic (boneless white meat), and the waffles are well made. ??I'll come back just for this dish. Service is weirdly incompetent, in a way that makes you wonder how long these people have been waiting tables. ??You get the impression that everyone working there just started working in a restaurant for the first time, and some of them really have no idea what's going on. ??So be prepared to wave down your server multiple times throughout your meal (like when you need to order, or you need a refill, or you need your check, or you have a question, or basically any task requiring a server)."
3,1,"uhh, talk about over hyped pizza. so glad they have a take-out section because they told me that the wait for 2 people around 7pm on a monday night was an hour. i would have been sorely disappointed if i waited an hour for this. got the margherita and the famous original. both came out to be $30. to get the best experience, we actually ate the pies as soon as we received them and it was just OKAY--it's nothing i haven't tried before, nothing that was mind-blowing, not that memorable other than the burnt bubbles along the crust. i dunno. why does this place have crazy good ratings? did i order something wrong?"
4,1,"Went there last night, really nice! Seated as soon as you get into the bar, very relax and casual perfect drinks after work! Although the bartender/waitress was slightly strange never there when we wanted her and kept coming over to us when we were in conversation. Which isn't all bad the beer and cider selection is amazing for NYC there's not alot of places for good beers and cider and they have snakebite and beer cocktails, i know sounds amazing! Definitely would go back!"
5,-1,"If you haven't been to Clinton street bakery yet, youve missed out on some phenomenal pancakes. But beware!! You will be waiting at least an hour and a half, depending on the day and time you decide to swing by the restaurant. If you can, check into the restaurant so you can get your name on the waiting list, go do whatever else you need to do, and then return back. If you time it just right, you won't need to wait too long to be seated. Ok, onto the food itself! If you read the other reviewers, all you read about are the pancakes and it is no joke! It is definitely worth it! My review is more about the eggs Benedict. The dish was elegantly Prepared, even after we told them to rush the order because of a time constraint I had on my part. They still took the time to make it look just right, so it earned some points with me. The hollandaise sauce was a little salty to my taste but the biscuit and ham cancelled that out real quick. It was a nice balance of sweet and salty. Overall, no complaints from my end. As for my girlfriend, she had the plain pancakes with the maple butter and she still gives it five stars each time she has it! Food wise, it is five stars all the way, but the only complaint would be the wait time. I signed up on the list and waited almost two hours before I got seated. I had to keep checking up on the guy with the list to make sure we didn't get bumped down accidentally. Each time I asked, the wait time got extended another 20 minutes. So once you sign up on the list, let them know you will be waiting outside. :-)"
5,-1,"I am absolutely obsessed with this place. ??A friend of mine told me about it, and after I haven't been there for a month or two, it starts floating back to my mind. First of all, its location is gorgeous and picturesque. ??The restaurant itself adds to this atmosphere - I usually can't stand small spaces, because I just feel like others' are on top of me and I can't even think straight. ??Somehow, Gitane manages to keep it peaceful and cozy, as opposed to chaotic. And, of course, the food is to die for. ??I have not eaten one even ""okay"" thing there yet. ??It's my total go-to place for people visiting the city, and no one has ever complained!"
5,-1,"Great pizza for a decent price ( for the area at least). For 4 bucks you can get a huge slice with lots of cheese and toppings.This place is great, even better drunk."
3,-1,"nice portions, good food, service can be better, music was a little too loud, but i was satisfied."
5,1,"Held an event for a big private party in the back room. ??Atmosphere AMAZING...warm, rustic feel and great vibe. ??Service was excellent as well."
5,-1,"Come here for Viet sandwiches, perhaps one of the best places in the city to do so. Consistency in the quality of the food they serve and service are exceptional! 4.5 Stars for these reasons. Recommend: The classic ??(#1 on the menu) and the chicken (#6) sandwiches..."
4,1,"I can say I've never had Cambodian food until Num Pang. ??Num Pang means sandwich and much like the Vietnamese Banh Mi, it is made with the baguette from the influences of the French when Cambodia was part of its empire. Num Pang is a small shack that has seating upstairs. ??I didn't go upstairs to eat, but rather ordered to go. ?? There is a counter window for you to place orders, and where you can see Num Pang workers making your sandwiches on the grill. ??The other side has a drink refrigerator and a counter for pickup. ??Space is so teeny tiny that it is impossible to move around much. ??I chose to stand by the door until my order was called. I tried one of the special sandwiches which was a ginger barbeque brisket. ??I took my sandwich to Union Square Park which is several blocks away. ??By the time I made it though, the bottom of my sandwich was mushy and softened from the hot steam in the box. ??The take away box is a nice cardboard made item that fits the sandwich nicely. ??There were loads of shredded and pickled carrots and cabbage. ??Few long strips of shaven cucumber, cilantro, and a chili mayo. ??The bread was warm and crispy on the top. ??You could taste the buttered bread and the chili mayo. ??The flavors were strong and delicious. ??The ginger brisket was spot on. ??You can taste the ginger and traces of acidity. ??The seasoning of the meat was not unfamiliar to me. ??The flavors tasted like a marinated beef nom that my mom makes at home, but without the big ginger taste and vinegary acidity. ??Though the sandwich is smaller than what you would get for a Vietnamese sandwich, it was substantial in filling and meat. ??It is a bit pricey for this sandwich coming in over $9, but it was tasty and the ingredients were fresh and well seasoned. Despite the cost, I would come back to taste more from Num Pang and be brave enough next time to squeeze through the congestion and climb the stairs to see if there is any sitting room."
5,1,Everything I had was delicious particularly the Himalayan Khatsa. If you are scared of spice stay away it's a good heat ??I would say medium and as you eat it it gets hotter but just get a Thai iced tea and it will cool things off. Everything is fresh enjoy! Great service too and SUCH GREAT PRICES.
2,-1,"Portions of Food were fantastic. But alot for a lunch time meal. STILL HAVE TWO MAJOR COMPLAINTS! 1. I am a ""Arnold Palmer"" drinker, since I don't do sodas. I was on a vacation trip, and had NO ISSUES getting the drink, in 6 states, and multiple restaurants, on a daily basis. I asked for that same thing at Carmine's, and Kisha the waitress told me they used "" Raspberry Flavored Tea"". WHAT I ENDED UP WITH WAS A 13 DOLLAR low Alcohol drink, that wasn't what I wanted. 2. Since we were pressed with time, we literally had to search down the waitress, to get the bill. After I got bill, I had to go on another search for someone to take my credit card. When NO ONE could find Kisha, I asked for the manager, and it was another, "" Where's Marco"" game. From looking for my bill, too paying it, took 25 MINUTES DURING LUNCH TIME. BY FAR IT WAS THE WORSE SERVICE I FOUND DURING 12 DAYS OF TRAVEL."
4,1,I came here on Saturday for lunch. Only one other table was here but I'm okay with that. We got the squid ink pasta (so much flavor and the pasta was cooked just right) and the penne alla caprese (had so much more flavor than I expected!). The only thing is that I wish it was a little cleaner inside. I didn't like the plastic table clothes. But I'd still return since the food was really good.
4,1,"came here for a friend's birthday. The wait time was 60-90 minutes on a Saturday night, I guess to be expected. Was told the steak was really good (I think it was the Rib Eye) A bit pricey but not too bad since we were originally going to Peter Lugers. The mash was also really good. If you are adventurous try the bleu cheese ice cream. Waiter said you'll either love it or hate it."
4,1,"6/28/08, 5:30 pm Went on Yelp recommendation as well as recognizing them from Food Network and I was not disappointed. ?? We arrived without reservations and were seated within minutes. ??We were not seated in the main dining room, but were taken back to the kitchen and up a flight of stairs to what appeared to be a newly renovated dining area. ??It was cramped and not very luxurious, but the wait staff was very attentive, efficient and friendly. ?? The one Yelp that caught my eye was written by Justin S., who says: ""Amy Ruth's chicken is all, ""What's up, bitch?"" to the other fried chicken around town, and the other chicken is all, CRY-SOB-DIE,"" and is absolutely right. ?? That was the best friggin fried chicken I ever had. ??My dining companions had the Fish Platter and the Smothered Chicken & Waffles, both were similarly wonderful. ??The sides were a mixed batch - the mac & cheese was really good, the collard greens were the best ever, but the fried okra was not so great - it came out long after the rest of the meal (they threw in a free dessert to compensate) and was fried whole okra. ??They weren't bad, but I prefer the okra to be cut into coins before battering. ?? I like my Sweet Tea really sweet, but Amy Ruth's was just sickeningly, syrupy sweet. ??Holy diabetes in a glass, Batman! ??I could only manage to slurp down three glasses. ?? The price was great, $47 for the 3 of us and we all left STUFFED. ??We had to take that free dessert to go. ?? I really enjoyed my visit to Amy Ruth's. ??It certainly lived up to all the hype. ??I probably would have given a 5-star review if we had been seated in the main dining room. ??The room we were seated in upstairs just was not fitting to the food and service."
4,1,"Like the romantic, cozy and friendly environment, which makes ABC Kitchen a perfect place for getting together with friends, or dating. These four stars are for their decoration and environment. The food is displayed beautiful and delicate, but I'm not crazy about it. It may because I'm not a big fun of cheese, butter, and meat. Every body has different taste, so my dislike might be your like, vice versa. Anyways, it's worth going there and see if you like:)"
5,1,"I took my Mom here this week during our visit to NYC and again, I was not disappointed! ??I had the chicken and my Mom tried the kielbasa. ??Both were fresh, flavorful and just downright delicious! ??The fresh flowers are impressive and such a nice touch. ??Our server was great - friendly, efficient and very helpful in describing several of the dishes to us."
2,1,"The concept and the vibe is fun enough, and even the menu is a throw back, but the food was mediocre at best. Chicken and waffles were so bland and nothing had any ""oomph"" of deliciousness. The chicken was dry, overlooked, and resembled the bulk frozen chicken that comes in a big bag from Costco. Very average. Even what my friends got just seemed so blah, which was confusing because the menu really is cool. I wouldn't come back."
5,-1,"This place is fantastic! First of all, it's gorgeous inside. The food is super flavorful and the menu clearly very well thought out, but with none of the pretension that usually comes with lots of these new Brooklyn hotspots. The service and overall ambiance is welcoming and friendly. I had lots of questions about the wine cocktails, because I didn't know what most of them were. We sat at the bar and our bartender couldn't have been more patient and helpful. The portions aren't huge, but ??everything is so rich and flavorful that I don't think they're supposed to be. Will definitely be back!"
5,1,"I have been to Cuba numerous times for a number of different occasions. ??The atmosphere here is very flexible, if that makes much sense. ??For a group of friends, the upstairs seating is ideal as they offer live Cuban jazz on Thurs(?) through Saturday evenings after 10. ??The last time I came for dinner with a lady friend and we were seated downstairs, where the romantic candle-lit ambience was uniquely complimented by jazz instrumentals of American popular/rock music (Red Hot Chili Peppers - ""Aeroplane"", for one). ??She had a mojito - her first experience with one - and I had a caipirinha. ??We had a healthy buzz going in no time. ??The croquetas de jamon as an appetizer are second to none, and platanos maduros as a side to the entree are a must. ??As any good Cuban restaurant should, they make a delicious steak. ??I usually stick to beef, but last time I went with the paella valenciana to revisit my peninsular roots, and it did not disappoint. ??Service was superb as always, but after speaking with friends who have dined here as well, this may be attributed to the fact that I am able to converse with the staff in Spanish. ??If you are a cigar aficionado like myself, you may not be impressed with the quality of their stogies, but the novelty of seeing them hand rolled was enough to win me over (you also can't beat a gratis cigar!) ??Overall, an excellent choice for a party, date, or just for a few drinks."
4,1,"Great bubble tea, and tasty banh mi sandwiches. ??Boba has a great consistency and is sweet. ??Had the almond milk green tea which was more on the milky side but still good. ??Tried the chicken and pork banh mi sandwiches--both were good but the pork one was the definite winner. ??Spicy is not very spicy, although bits of the fresh jalape?¡Óo may have a kick. ??This place seems to get crowded, as I was here after 2pm and there was still a decent line and no spots to sit. ??They have seating for ~20 people."
3,1,Great atmosphere but the food is ok. I think it's better when you dine in rather than getting it delivered obviously but I wish they had better selections. Sometimes the food comes out a little bland and dry. Great scene though but one of my least favorites in the neighborhood.
5,1,"Adore this place. It is so cute inside. In the morning/afternoon, a lot of natural sunlight comes in so it's so wonderful! Okay, food. Blueberry pancakes - AH amazing. Fluffy, soft, DELICIOUS maple butter syrup sauce. Spanish Scramble - o m g. what a great order. omelette, bread, and potatoes. YUM. Come with a friend. Each order one and share each thing. Oh man, so great. Always happy with this place."
1,-1,"are these people for real? ??i will start by saying the only thing i've had there is the ""basic"" tacos. ??but they were so bad i didn't even bother to try the rest of the stuff. the beans were flavorless and the tortilla was prepared in a way that made it dry and brittle. ??and no vegetables. ??the absolute worst part, though, is that the cheese consisted of them placing pre-sliced white american (or swiss?) cheese on it as if we were in a college dorm room. ??really? ??i'm paying $3 for a college dorm room taco with a slice of american/swiss cheese? ??never. ??again."
5,-1,"Oh Balthazar. ??I love you. ??I love you for dinner at a booth on the line. ??I love you for lunch, solo, at the bar. ??I love you tucked into a corner for breakfast with my man. ??I just love the way you smell, the the bustling, your all-business servers, your omelets and frittes, your bread and butter, your steak, chicken or fish, your onion tarte and oh, ??your expresso. ??Honestly I adore desert, but the experience I have with you is always so sweet and satisfying, I've never longed for or tasted your dessert Balthazar But I will be back. xo"
4,-1,On busy Christmas Day we sat at the Antipasto Bar and enjoyed a nice afternoon meal. ??Staff all were cordial and polite. ??Food was perfect. ??Highly recommended.
2,-1,"yeah. $120 dinner for two on Franklin and Green in deep Greenpoint. ??Steak tartare was good. The soup was great. The mussels were tasty enough. ??Unfortunately, when it's apparent the bartender/server would rather be elsewhere for her Saturday evening....all things good are negated. ??It was obvious that it was our time to leave--the cocktail was cleared sans the offer for another, the cell phones came out, the restlessness ensued--at 10:30pm on a Saturday evening. ??Give me a break. ??She must been recovering from her New Years. Never again."
5,1,"The previous workers of another bar forged together with friends to make a long lasting Establishment called Smithfield. 3 floors, tv's everywhere, great music. I met all 5 bartenders, the owners and GM. The vibe here is amazing. They will have all the futbol & rugby games played here so make sure to stop by for the games. They have a great selection for food from the kitchen. The most expensive thing is $14. The first night it was packed, that's how much peoplelove the owners. No need to name any names. But gentlemen, I thank you for giving me back my second home. This review will be updated on subsequent visits. All I have to say is come here, now!!!! And witness the majesty of Smithfield. If possible, visit the Wallace room and learn the history behind the naming of this bar."
5,-1,"Had dinner last night with a few foodie friends and we shared several dishes which were all absolutely beautifully prepared, (ART on a plate) and mouthwatering! ?? 1. ??BBQ Pork Buns: ??They were extremely tender and juicy, with just enough sauce. 2. ??Salmon Belly Tartare: ??The combination of ingredients made us curious and we loved this so much, we ordered another one. ??It was creative and just divine. 3. ??Seafood & Chips: ??This actually had chunks of lobster and while I was with a refined group, we all kept using our fingers because it was just that good! 4. ??Crispy Chicken & Waffles: ??Incredibly scrumptious combination of food. ??The Waffles were so fresh and moist, while the chicken was perfectly seasoned and crispy. ??We didn't even use much syrup because we did not want to cover the flavor of the chicken (another dish we are having at brunch tomorrow). 5. ??Shrimp & Grits: ??My Southern friend said between the Chicken & Waffles and this dish, someone must have a Southern Momma because these were both the best he had ever had. ??I had never tried grits before but loved this dish so much, we are going back for brunch tomorrow! ?? Overall, extensive and creative menu. ??Beautifully prepared and plated. ??Will try to save room for desert next time. We went back for Brunch and had the Shrimp & Grits, Chicken & Waffles and added the Bleecker Omelet. ?? Everything was just as good as we remember and the Omelet was so fluffy without a trace of color except the yellow of the eggs. ??Impressive! ?? The bartender was just adorable and very attentive without being intrusive. ??Brunch drinks were fantastic. ??All too often, bartenders add too much juice/mixer or too much alcohol. Thanks Celest!"
5,-1,"Wow. ??This restaurant is awesome. ??My sister took me out for my bday to this restaurant last week. ??The service is great, very friendly staff, and the food was really wonderful. ??Go for the chicken dish, it delicious."
5,-1,"Some of the best seasoned rotisserie chicken you can find in the area! It has the feeling of being back in Coamo, PR. Love it."
1,1,"This was my first time here and my last. From the moment the bouncer ID'd my BF. He was annoying. My friend wrote a review below and all is extremely accurate. The only thing is I don't regret telling the bouncer he was being extremely over bearing and that we were not in a club so he should BACK OFF!. I didn't call him a name. But, i was very stern with him and asked him to stop harassing paying customers. I also mentioned I complained about his behavior to mgmt. Which I did and to be honest i truly believe that the bouncer's behavior was because of the Mgr request. So 2 were playing at this game. The bouncer most definitely over reacted by my words of truth and would not let me in again. I had my CC at the bar. All i wanted to do was get it and close my tab. Which turned into him grabbing me forcefully and pushing me out. I called 911 got my CC back with nothing charged on it (the least they can do). As big as this bouncer was i felt sad for him. I wasn't afraid of him in anyway. The fact that he took what i said and made it into a big deal was sad. Especially since all NYC bouncers adore me. It was as if i was talking to challenged person. He deserved to hear it and just MAYBE this 5'2"" lady speaking up and standing up to these guys can help other patrons wanting to spend a nice ngt out drinking without being harassed a chance to enjoy themselve. Peace and love"
2,-1,"While the food was just OK and the rose was subpar, ??the service and attitude of the staff needs to be revamped. ??We had to ask our server twice for drinks that were not delivered, and at one point, he spilled an entire glass of water on me and into my pocketbook. ??I understand that accidents happen, and I received many ""I'm so sorry"", but they (I saw him talking to what appeared to be management about the mishap) didn't even offer to buy me a glass of wine. That shows a complete lack of regard for the patrons. ??Needless to say, ??we will never be returning to this establishment."
4,1,"Yes it is on the top five best burgers I have had in New York... Love it here Like the great selection they have of burgers and sides, one for everyone. The atmosphere is alright, not the most cozy - mor like a fancy fastfood restaurant. The service is also alright, they where very helpfull as we where 5 people trying to squeze us in at a 4 person table. The only thing I don??t like is the - no seating before the whole party is there. But I am def. coming back for more - really nice burgers."
4,1,"Had a great brunch here with some girlfriends. The mimosas were excellent, but they ran out of lychee half way through our meal, which was a little disaplointing. I would definitely come back again though because my meal was also very excellent- chicharron with watermelon....mmmm.."
5,1,"Last month, my mother brought me to Atera for a three-hour multi-course dinner. It was quite an experience, theatrical and lively, with pricey tickets purchased in advance. Service was impeccable, and the food was fun and often delicious. We came on time for a 6:00 reservation, and a young host led us downstairs to a cozy lounge. We ordered cocktails, both of which were summery and delicious. The Carrot was a bright mix of Aperol, brandy, carrot juice, carrot vinegar, and lemon; the Meyer Shrub was light and refreshing, with beer, Meyer lemon, tonka bean, and vinegar. When the time came, we were led to the main dining room. It was a small modern space, centered around a beautiful open kitchen. All twenty or so diners had great views of the work that went into each dish. And there was so much work - the plating alone must have been exhausting. Atera's presentation was gorgeous and creative, with a different slate or jar or planter box for almost every bite. The meal started with a series of snacks. The first was one of the best - beer foam macarons with creme fraiche and caviar, the dainty shells crackling then melting away. Next came flaxseed cookies with coriander and pine nut butter, then rutabaga, lightly pickled and coated with beeswax. Tiny wafers of amaranth toast came stuffed with trout roe and a ramp tartar sauce - these were a briny crisp highlight. Then ""lobster rolls,"" with airy meringue and small mounds of meat that didn't quite benefit from being chopped up. Beef tendon were like chewy pork rinds, cooked up with an uni fish sauce. The next two came together - soft pickled ""quail eggs"" and pigs' blood wafers with chicken liver p??t?? and huckleberry. The quail eggs were the first of many instances of trompe l'oeil cooking - they looked exactly like quail eggs but were actually deviled egg filling shaped with liquid nitrogen then wrapped in thin skins of milk. Delicious as well as enchanting, creamy and supple enough to fool. Bone marrow followed, torched and served in edible bones made of heart of palm. The last snack was swordfish belly cured and served dripping with pork fat - fish made into lunch meat. The main part of our meal kicked off with a fresh salad of big eye tuna with fingernail-sized vegetables. Then came two of the best dishes of the night. First was a small mound of razor clam, almond, and garlic, all sliced, blanched, treated, et cetera, so that they were impossible to differentiate until tasted. The play of textures was marvelous, and the flavors subtle but lovely. Next came a similar display of sea urchin and carrots, with a few herbs and petals. The soft orange carrot was perfect with the luscious unadulterated uni. Diver scallop came next, lightly cooked then draped over sour cabbage with hazelnut butter for dipping. Then there was dried salmon with pork gel and a dusting of black licorice. A single peekytoe crab ravioli followed, floating in a toasted grain dashi. The broth was very salty but soothing, and the yuba-wrapped crab made a pleasant dumpling. At this point we got some salted rye bread with butter steeped with cheese. A sourdough roll basted with mangalesa pork fat came shortly after. The meal continued with chewy seppia noodles in roasted chicken bouillon. Green market fava beans came next, grilled in the pod, served with seaweed in a walnut consomm??. The Fourchu lobster was another highlight of our dinner, dusted with chicken and corn powder with lobster butter on the side. The cold water lobster was sweet and meaty, with a fine tender texture I'd never quite encountered before. The savory part of our dinner closed with roasted squab breast and rack of lamb. The squab came with a ragout of tomato, squab liver, and squab and duck hearts, as well as with roasted garlic scape; the lamb with black walnut and wheatberry. The desserts were delicious and wonderfully playful. First there was a bright bowl of juiced rhubarb with caraway yogurt and berries. Then the broken egg - this was the most innovative dessert I've ever seen, with the exact look of a brown egg cracked to reveal boiled whites and a drooling yolk. It tasted good too, some combination of ice cream, sugar, and custard. Milk and crackers came next, two thin wafers over frozen milk and strawberries. The toasted walnut sundae wasn't that tasty, but it featured a pretty cool fake walnut made out of celery root. Bourbon cask ice cream sandwiches were simple and legitimately delicious. The meal ended with ""chocolate pretzels"" and ""black walnuts"" - chocolate and caramel mignardises, presented with genius. Without the spectacle, I might give Atera four stars, as the creativity sometimes came at the cost of flavor. The overall experience, though, was a slam dunk. We oohed and aahed and had a splendid time, pampered by the excellent staff. When we went home, my mom made this video, which she is very proud of: youtube.com/watch?v=DuRD?£á?. Watch it and drool - that's what I'm doing now."
3,-1,"I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could. I recently came here for my birthday after reading reviews on Yelp and after a friend of mine raved about the cheap happy hour. On the plus side, I was expecting a JAM PACKED bar, but it wasn't overcrowded at all. I also called a few days in advance and reserved a large table for my group, even though we were just getting drinks. That was definitely what pushed me to come here. However, you get what you pay for. The $5 drinks, though a good deal, weren't that great. I stuck with sangria because I didn't want to have a massive lychee hangover the next day, but the cups were so filled with ice that each glass had only a few sips (or $5 worth) of sangria. Not complaining because I was able to get tipsy for cheap, but its probably a better value to go somewhere with $13 really great cocktails. The other reason why I have to give this place 3.5 stars is because of the server- she was pretty bitchy. It took a really long time to get drinks and whenever she came over to the table she would listen to half the people's orders and then walk away. She definitely had a lot of tables to deal with (I think maybe the whole place), but that's a management issue, not mine. Overall I had a good time, but I don't know that I'd make this my regular happy hour spot."
4,1,"I came back for the tenderloin! ??It was so much food, but I Kobayashied my way through! The goat cheese fritters really balanced out the meat well, and the mushrooms were excellent. ??I wasn't thrilled sitting right next to the kitchen during a humid day, but I think this is a new go-to for a nice meal in a great area."
5,1,"A friend recommended Ippudo to me during a visit to New York in October, 2009. ??Best ramen I've ever had, by far! My friends and I went here during dinner on a Saturday so there was quite a wait (45 min - 1 hour) but it was well worth it. ?? First off, I love the decor of Ippudo. ??The wall in the waiting area is adorned with soup bowls and the glass counter at the bar cleverly encases squares of dried noodles that line the entire counter. The main dining room looks sleek and modern. ??We were seated at our own booth, spacious enough to seat 6 people (and probably more if necessary) which gave us a great view of the entire dining area as well as the the kitchen staff merrily cooking away. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful in offering recommendations. For starters we ordered several appetizers but the only ones that I can recall were the chicken wings and Hirata pork buns. ??The chicken wings were quite good but we were all blown away by the pork buns. ??In my opinion, I think the pork buns at Ippudo are better than Momofuku. I am going to echo the reviews of many other yelpers and say that the pork buns were just heavenly. ??The consistency of the buns were light and fluffy. The was pork was so soft and succulent that it just melted in your mouth. ??Combined with their tasty sauce, it's positively orgasmic for your palate! Our table got a mix of different ramen but the most popular choices were the Akamaru Modern and the Shoyu Ramen. ??I ordered the Akamaru Modern and it was absolutely THE.MOST.DIVINE bowl of ramen that I've ever had! I cannot emphasize this enough...it is one of those meals that tastes so good you're gonna say OMG. The noodles were cooked perfectly - not too soft and not overcooked. ??And the broth was so full of flavor without being overwhelmingly salty. It was a bowl of absolute ramen heaven. ??I had a taste of the Shoyu Ramen which my boyfriend ordered. I think the shoyu has a saltier flavor but it was still just as tasty as the Akamaru Modern. ""Eating ramen will guarantee to make you happy"" ??- this is no lie, particularly here at Ippudo. Writing this review just made me wish I was back in New York. Average price per person: $20-30 depending on whether you order multiple orders of the pork buns (which we did). Well worth it!"
5,-1,"Amazing atmosphere and food. ??When requested, the bartenders know how to 'stir' a good martini. The appetizers were over the top."
5,-1,"Arrived really early on a Friday night so we were able to get in without a reservation. So what if they are no longer BYOB - it's all about the food here, which is great. Our waiter was attentive even after the crowd spilled into the street. I love French food and have been to some of the ""best"" in NYC - now when I think of best I have to include this place."
4,1,"I think I was Serbian in a previous life. Dancing, drinking and eating ensued on a Friday night at this packed little restaurant. The owner and all of the staff are inviting and although there was a bit of a wait, we were ok hanging out at the bar. If you like meat, I recommend you come here. There's lots and lots of it, it's tasty, and prices are pretty decent. They have live music some nights (I know they do on Fridays and Saturdays at the very least) and the crowd is a mix of Serbians (of all ages) and the regular East Village hipster. I left in a food comma and I highly recommend it. Go here!"
4,-1,"The menu is basic and the same all day long, but the food is quite good and so is the service. Still, the draw here is the space itself, which is absolutely beautifully designed and enormous. It's on the same block as The Bell House, so hopefully people will find out about it that way. Otherwise I worry that it's off the beaten path and no one knows it's there. It's enormous so needs to really draw crowds for it to operate in the black, I would imagine. The major limitation at this point is the menu, which is rather limited and I hope that eventually they expand. But by all means GO and bring your friends! Spread the word! Gowanus really needs places like this to succeed. Bahche management, if you are reading this, please advertise and make your presence known."
5,1,"i've been dreaming of this food since going there on tuesday. ??the food was honestly some of the best i've had in forever and you could taste ever fresh ingredient. ??the gnocchi was perfect and is how gnocchi should be done, but is rarely done so it melts in your mouth. ??i would say share this as an appetizer. ??the kale salad was also amazing and so fresh and light. ??another good app. ??the risotto was dreamy and incredible. ??i can't say enough good things."
4,-1,"Graffiti is a great experience. After reading an article about it's kitchen space (approx. 40sq. ft.), and then learning more about the chef, I decided this place was worth a visit. While it is true that the portions are small, the dishes are well thought out - all very flavorful, well-seasoned, and with a touch of uniqueness (e.g. pork dumplings with grapefruit). This is also a restaurant where you can learn directly from the chef what he was trying to achieve - outlining flavor profiles of each dish. He came over to our table numerous times to tell us about the dishes (despite being busy for a 16+ seat joint). Being able to eat at a restaurant where the chef is well trained, and interact with him during your meal makes Graffiti a must visit. A bottle of wine and 5 plates, plus tip can get you out of there at about $100.00 And just in case I was there on a night when the chef happened to be there (though I suspect he is there almost every day), it would have still been worth it. Don't forget to stick your head in the kitchen - that is about all you can fit in there!"
5,1,"I absolutely love the Japanese desserts. My favorites are: Zenzai (matcha green tea with mochi, red bean paste, chestnut, and sake ice cream) black sesame creme brulee GREEN TEA ROLL CAKE is my absolute favorite. It always runs out when you go there like later at night, so if you want to get it, go a little earlier. Despite how delicious the desserts are, the wait is pretty long, usually from 30-50 minutes. However, they accept reservations on Thursdays, so that's something you can do. Oh and they only accept cash."
3,1,"The sushi is pretty good. This is a fusion spot - no fresh ginger here! Had the squash/shiitake mushroom appetizer which was delicious! Also got inari, AB spicy (shrimp), eel una bomb, spicy tuna hand roll, oyako, and the ramo veggie sushi. One surprising thing was that the tuna tasted as if it were from a can - kinda not cool for a sushi spot! All the other rolls were well made and freshly presented. Cool space but very loud during Wednesday dinner time. The waiter who was serving the couple next to us was being SO loud. It's a hang, for sure."
4,1,"I think the only reason I'm not giving this place five stars is because the lunch treats are ready-made as opposed to fresh from a salad bar. That said this place is lush. Lots of yummy salads to choose from and everything is organic and home-made. The cookies here are good too. On a nice day you can eat in by the open window, a homely feel with friendly service and stock that you can buy to replish your kitchen supplies."
1,1,"Got the Margherita slice and and Artichoke slice. Couldn't even eat the margherita slice because the entire bottle of oil used on top weighed it down and all the cheese came off...the crust was sopping wet with oil. The artichoke slice was good but couldn't eat more than 3 bites because it was too heavy and too salty. ??Also, the crust was so thick...not for my liking...it was like a roll. ??All it was was spinach and artichoke dip on a pizza. Won't be back. Terrible!"
4,-1,"Even though Becco is known for their amazing pasta prix fixe, we decided to eat a little lighter post-theatre. First off, the service was phenomenal. Leighton made sure that we were taken care of at every turn. Our bartender also took very good care of us. The initial pour of my Manhattan was about 2 millimeters short (honestly, no big deal), and although it was fine, about a minute after the Manhattan was poured the bartender was out from behind the bar, muttering ""not on my watch"" as he topped off the Manhattan. It was a wonderful show of top-notch service. We started off with one of the specials, Smoked mozzarella burrata with broccoli rabe on Tuscan bread. It was delicious - and after having a piece of Tuscan bread all by itself, I could see why it was the foundation of the starter. Wonderful, chewy and crisped on the outside...yum! Next we enjoyed the pomegranate salad (it was one of those nights where ALL the specials sounded good, so that's what we went with) and while it was lovely, it didn't really overly excite the mouth. For our entree we chose the grilled swordfish in a tomato-ey sauce that was fantastic. We actually split everything and the swordfish came out on two plates - the portion was large enough to fill both of us and we were glad that we'd split it. Great texture on the grilled fish, it was up there with the best swordfish I've had recently."
4,1,"I visited this restaurant last night for a friend's birthday. ??Upon looking at the menu online, I was unimpressed, but was pleasantly surprised with what Feast had to offer. ??After much deliberating, my table decided to choose the French Feast tasting menu. ??Our waitress was friendly and informative, and the presentation of the dishes was great. ??All the dishes were delicious, but some rose above the others. ??Everyone at the table enjoyed the meal, and although it was pricey, we did not leave hungry. Favorite dishes: Lobster Choucroute Foie Gras & Sweetbreads Coq Au Vin Pomme Dauphinois Eclaire Gateau"
5,-1,"WE MISSED YOU!!! The only thing better than Bonita is Carino -- owned and operated by the heartbeat and soul of Bonita -- the manager and staff! The food is excellent and the decor is authentic and down-home. Carino is awesome and it's evident in the shared neighborhood smiles and excitement seen throughout the restaurant on any given night, that Sergio and the crew were missed and have filled the void our neighborhood was missing. Mexican food is back in Wmsbg!"
5,1,"I'm not sure if my last review made an impact but this week when I sat down for lunch they had the Lunch specials menu readily available on the table!! Wow!! I didn't have to ask for it this time! I was and am very happy about this!! They also handed us wet towelettes!! Nice courtesy!! The food as usual was very satisfyingly tasty!! So yes, now I can rate them with the 5 stars!! ??You go guys!! Keep up the good work!!!"
5,1,Steamed pork buns all day everyday. 2 for $9 (sort of pricey) but so good. I don't think I've ever ordered anything else from this place...
5,-1,"Absolutely love this place Food and drink are amazing & food is fresh every time. And service is just exceptional!! I defiantly recommend to anyone for drinks & fine dining. This is one of our favorite places for drinks, lunch or breakfast, we haven't signed bad experience. This is where other bad restaurant should sent their staff to observe as to how a service-oriented establishment should run a business!"
5,1,"Brunch: came here on a Wednesday around noon after being super pleased that this place does brunch food 10-4 every single day! And there's nothing better than breakfast food, Mediterranean style. Located in the beautiful area that is Park Slope, this place fits in perfect with an awesome laid back vibe and pretty decor. It gets a ton of natural light as the front of the building is all glass, with a great view down a typical park slope street. The experience started off with a ""generous"" pour of Rose from our server/bartender (hopefully his manager doesn't see this). We almost ordered the hummus platter to share, plus a brunch entree for each of us, but the manager who we had begun chatting with recommended it would be too much, so we just got a side of falafel instead of the platter: he was right. He was extremely helpful in our decision making, so that we were able to order what food we wanted but also experience new Israeli cuisine. The side of falafel was delicious and a perfect appetizer. I believe it's green pea falafel, which isn't quite as good as chickpea IMO but still great nonetheless; if a place has falafel, you order it. The mixed mushroom, thyme, and fontina omelette was one of the better omelettes I've had, and I'd say I'm pretty much an omelette connoisseur. It comes with delicious potatoes on the side and a pointless salad (I'm bias against salads). I would recommend getting at least a side order of the challah bread, because, well, it's part of the Israeli experience, I think. I had a hard time deciding on the second dish, as their menu is pretty incredible. Went with the shakshuka poached eggs in a tomato pepper sauce with a side of hummus and pita (they don't skimp you on the hummus either). This was something relatively new for me and it did not disappoint. Sauce is very salsa-like and goes awesome with the poached eggs: very original dish. Careful if you have an uneasy stomach though. We then walked it off down the beautiful streets of Brooklyn with it's tree lined avenues and gorgeous brownstones (I have an affinity for Brooklyn). I will be back."
4,1,"Went to Uva for a friend's bridal shower and it was lovely! ??We had the entire back greenhouse-type area and it was great - it was breezy and comfortable, and then when it got too hot, Uva staff quickly had the cover up and the AC on, which was terrific. ??I've uploaded a pic of the special menu just for us, which was also nice - the tables were set with a personalized menu at each place. ??Waitstaff took drink orders right when we arrived. ??The first thing we had was chisolino (Emilian focaccia) with robiola cheese and truffles. ??Overpowering truffle flavor but tasty! ??The opening bruschette were varied and tasty. ??We asked for bread and oil which was brought out and it too was just so yummy and fluffy and fresh. ??I had the Insalata Mista which was good - nothing special but fine. ??I had the short ribs - BIGGEST PORTION of short ribs I'd ever had, by far - usually you get short rib (singular)! ??They were good, not great. ??Dessert was brought in by the bride-to-be's family but expertly cut and served by Uva staff. ??I had iced tea and white wine which were great. ??Just a positive, four-star experience!"
5,-1,A super sweet date place that won't bust your paycheck. Good bar. Great beers! This menu has like 8 things & they are written in english. It's pretty small but laid back & nobody has any attitudes here! Try it out!
4,-1,"Wow I have been coming here since I was a kid. ??Food prices are cheap, the food is delicious and it is open all the time! For something very fast, get the wonton noodle soup. ??3.75, last time i went there. ??You order it and 4 minutes later it is ready in front of your eyes. But my absolutely favorite is green peas with beef over rice and with a egg, sunny side up. ??Nothing better than that. Also try the soft egg with beef over rice. ??Just hop on over and try everything on the menu."
5,1,Small place with huge flavors. ??Prices were extremely cheap but everything had distinct flavors. ?? BYOB and order food at the register. ?? We ordered to share and everything was delicious. ??Would definitely try to stop by again next time I'm in NYC
5,1,"Great bar, all around! ??Service, food, drink selection - this place has it all. ??It's just a few blocks from Penn Station/MSG so the location is ideal for pre-game/pre-concert activities. ??There are 3 levels to this place so if you walk in and get turned off because you think it's too crowded, be sure to check out the upstairs because that offers some more room to stretch out. ?? the burgers and salads here are awesome, as are just about every single appetizer they offer (the shrimp buns are insanely good, as is the maple-glazed slab of bacon and jameson whiskey wings). ?? Selfishly, the only reason why I hesitated writing a review was because I wanted to keep this place all to myself - but the secret is out: Smithfield is legit!"
4,-1,We planned our morning/early afternoon to have lunch in the tavern. Wonderful food and the best service possible. People that work here really do care about the customer's experience.
5,-1,"Don't get the wrong idea--this place has completely homely ambiance. ??Don't go there to impress anyone. ??Go there to have good pasta and salad at a fair price in an otherwise over-priced area. ?? I've been coming to Il Corallo since 1996. ??I don't think the decor, the staff, or the penne melanzane has changed. ??I feel like I'm walking into Seinfeld-era NYC when I come here. ?? Which is a good thing. ??You know what? ??I'm giving it five stars. ??I am so very grateful that this place exists."
4,1,"A wonderful addition to the neighborhood. For me, the stand outs are the burger and the pierogis."
4,-1,"Came here for drinks the other night before heading across the street to Hudson Clearwater for dinner (so can't really comment on the food). This is a newly opened restaurant, and seemed like it would be a great place to meet friends for dinner. The interior is very classily decorated, and has a cool/calm and inviting atmosphere. The bartenders make great drinks, and seem to take great pride in the preparation and presentation (as do many upscale bars/lounges in NYC). Overall, I will definitely be back here in the future for drinks / dinner."
3,1,"Nice atmosphere, friendly service, reasonable prices. ??Went for dinner. ??LOVED the Mediterranean salad. ??It out shined our entrees. ??Overall, I think the tiny plates and appetizers may be the way to go over the main courses. ??We had he chicken schwarma and Branzino; both were a bit bland; but maybe that is the cuisine. ??We'd go back though."
5,-1,"absolutely one of the best dining experiences ever. Me and my date sat at the bar. Our bartender was amazing. Asked us what kind of alcohols were our favorites and whirled up deliciousness. True genius! Food was great too. Wonderful dining experience. If anything negative, it does get crowded."
1,-1,"They brought the wrong food. The staff and the manger did not apologies. I had asked specifically asked for vegetarian food but brought a seafood food. When they were told about the wrong dish, they showed attitude instead of apologizing. I made the correct food to go since they spoiled my mood to eat in."
5,1,Authentic Peruvian food. ??Lomo saltado and pollo a la brasa were Wow! We also loved the chicha morada (purple non-alcoholic drink) and the aji verde.
4,-1,"This place serves up a mean steak and fantastic lobster salad. I think that there's pretty good service, but it really depends on who you get. The place is typically known for brunch, but it's not the ideal spot to take a date to. It's a little bit loud on the weekends, the ambiance isn't exactly romantic. I could imagine people primarily coming here for casual meetings with friends or business acquantices. Overall, pretty good place to find quality French cooking."
4,1,"Good find! Stopped in for dinner on a Friday. Makes the most of a pretty small space, managing to feel both cozy and airy at the same time. It seemed crowded but we were seated within 5 minutes. The cheeseburger was exactly what I wanted: tasty, buttery bun, quality meat, and fresh veggies. Also tried the chicken pasta and the mussels, yum! Although I would have loved a few more crostini to soak up the mussel broth. Beer selection was lackluster, but I guess that's what we get for ordering beer at a place that's clearly geared towards cocktails. Service was friendly but they were clearly busy, since no one noticed our empty drinks for about 20 minutes, at which point we were done with our meal and not wanting to stick around for another drink. The issues were minor, though, and I'd definitely go back. I really appreciated that all their plates were manageably-sized and made with fresh ingredients. Great place for a date or to catch up with a friend."
5,-1,One of my favorite places to get pizza in NYC. Good service and great food. I highly recommend the pizza with sausage and broccoli rabe and the vodka sauce pizza. Great salads as well.
4,1,Great place to enjoy long missing Japanese food! Authentic and great quality. Handmade Udon is worth trying. My favorite is Beef tongue and the sake sorbet .
4,1,"Had a great experience here for my sister's birthday lunch. Cocktails were great and this restaurant's salad managed to make my impossible-to-please grandmother happy. We all enjoyed our food. They couldn't get 5 stars as service left a little to be desired. Apparently there was a special our waiter didn't tell us about, and it took very long to get the check"
5,-1,"We were in the mood for Italian food...this place popped up so we gave it a chance. The food, atmosphere and service was 5 star. Really great. The Papardelle with short rib ragu was outstanding. We had 4 other dishes and each was equally impressive. A must visit. You won't be disappointed."
1,-1,"Food: Went for brunch. This was my first time at Locanda Verde and the second time for my sister and bro-in-law. ??Menu was nice, if pricey, but I wanted conventional breakfast fare. ??I asked the waiter ??whether he preferred the waffle, the pancakes, or the french toast (all dressed up versions of each). ??He cautioned ""not the french toast."" ??OK, pancakes it was. ??My plate of ricotta pancakes topped with fresh blueberries and lemon curd looked like something from a magazine, ??but each pancake was basically a sealed envelope of raw batter. ??""Waiter, they seem a little undercooked"" ??""Oh no, they are supposed to be like that, they have ricotta."" (completely indiscernible to the taste). ?? An hour later, I'm feeling sick to my stomach. ??I can only imagine the gooey mess of raw egg that the french toast must be. ??My sister's frittata was ""uninspired"" and my and my bro-in-law's uovo modena (poached eggs with hollendaise sauce) and pork hash was tasty but ""nothing special and pretty hard to screw up."" ??The tab for the three of us with coffee but no alcohol was $75 before tip. ??The fam, who as I mention had eaten there before say two times was enough, this place is not worth returning to, no matter what hype or PR DeNiro has bought for it. Service: ??Hostess was a class-A bitch who gave us the once over at 10am and then tried to seat us us next to the silverware station in the back, despite the fact the place was nearly empty (and was still nearly empty when we left an hour later). ??(We looked fine, we are all 30somethings in ??in finance for chrisakes -- sister lives in Tribeca, I live UWS). Prior to seating us she, in front of us, bawled out the ??'assistant hostess' who actually performs the act of seating guests for not following her instructions in seating the prior party (apparently this prior party also balked when they were thrown in the back corner and the assistant hostess seated them elsewhere without first receiving permission from her royal bitchiness.) ??Our waiter was nice but I should have known when he steered me away from the french toast that he was in on the hustle and that we would have been better off just about anywhere else. ?? Conclusion: go elsewhere."
5,-1,Best burger and decently priced for the city. The beer battered onion rings are delicious. One of my favorite parts of this place isn't the food its the condiments they have special condiments which are phenomenal. I would recommend this burger joint to anyone.
3,-1,Good service. Ok food.
5,-1,cheap and good thai food. you can try anything everything is good! love the seafood pad thai and the mango and coconut rice !
2,-1,Good place w good environment but the fish was so bad that i couldn't even believe they served it. Also i asked for pasta to go and waiter said the chef does not take pasta to go. Whyy i asked? He said thats just the chefs preference. Seemed illogical to me. Anyways i ended u paying 170 bucks for what seemed like nothing. 2 wines 2 salads 2 super bad raw fish
3,1,"Great Jones Cafe was a fun way to spend a Sunday afternoon catching up with friends. ??It's extremely small, but the warm, homey vibe lent itself to plenty of conversation. ??Brunch is a respectable $12.95, and the biggest plus that the coffee refills were free-a must after a long Saturday night. ??The food, however, was just OK-I ordered the andouille omelet with cornbread and home fries, and the cornbread was extremely dry and the omelet wasn't particularly special, either. ??Adding hot sauce certainly helped though. ??The waitress was friendly, though the hostess chastised us slightly because we told her we were a table of 4 and then another friend of ours showed up. ??Oops. All in all, I would definitely return."
5,-1,A diamond in the ruff. Food was fantastic and their top priority is making me happy!!!
4,-1,"I was here last night for my anniversary dinner. Since we moved into the area we have tried getting reservations many times and it has never worked out so we were excited to finally get reservations for a special occasion. I must say, I had very high expectations and they met almost all of them. The best part of the evening was the ambiance. The place was packed but not loud, just vibrant, good music, and good looking New Yorkers. Not a tourist-y place at all like all those trendy meatpacking restaurants. The waitstaff was also very knowledgeable. The portions are also perfect and the food delicious. I strongly recommend the Winter Salad and panacotta dessert. Downsides: not accommodating to a vegetarian diet AT ALL. I was able to order a few dishes when the waitress informed me that I could order the orechiette pasta without the duck sausage, and it was really delicious. My husband got the ravioli and it was equally impressive. It was expensive but not obscene. I hope to go back for another special occasion."
